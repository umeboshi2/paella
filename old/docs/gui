Paella Gui
============


Original gui design goals
------------------------------------

The original goals for the gui were to provide enough of an interface to the paella_ 
database to do simple operations needed to create traits and their components.  
Much of the gui was made without regard for new users, or users unfamiliar with 
the code or paella system.  Most of my time spent in developing paella has been focused
on the installer code, and in system design.  It can take a great deal of time in 
testing, troubleshooting problems and improving systems.  As a result, the gui is 
very minimalistic, and will not do all (although it will do most) necessary operations 
needed to make use of the database.


Gtk/Qt and Gnome/KDE
----------------------------------

There are two graphical management interfaces for paella.  One is written 
using pygtk_.  The other is written  using pykde_.  I started paella writing the 
pygtk interface, but during the end of 2004, I switched to developing with the
pykde interface.

Way back when I was using python1.5, I learned to write interfaces with pygtk.  At the 
time the qt license was not dfsg_ compatible, but gtk was.  By the time I got around 
to writing paella, I had plenty of inertia with pygtk, although there was a dfsg compatible 
qt available.

I decided to play around with pykde one day and found it a little easier than gtk.  It takes 
longer for me to write with pykde currently, because my relative exposure to when
compared to pygtk.  I am expecting that to change with time and practice. One of the 
things that attracted me to pykde is the lower level widget subclasses.  I haven't used
to much of pygnome because of it's poor widget selection, and the difficutly in using 
bonobo.  There don't seem to be many lowlevel replacements for gtk widgets that are 
gnome aware.  To be fair, at the time the pygnome docs weren't fulfilling, so I may have
missed out on something I didn't know about.  One example that I am thinking of is the 
KComboBox which is a QComboBox with text completion methods and configurable 
hotkeys.

Current State of Paella Gui
--------------------------------------

Currently, the gtk interface is completely deprecated, and the kde interface is being 
actively developed.  Most of the necessary functionality required to manage the 
paella database is implemented in the gui.  This does not mean that the gui is as 
functional as desired, but it is functional enough to do most of what is required.  A 
guide_ has been written explaining how to use the paella-managment gui.
