==============================
Known Problems with Paella_
==============================

.. contents:: :backlinks: entry

-----------------------------------
Introduction
-----------------------------------

This page details problems with paella that are planned to be fixed at some 
point in the future.  Be sure to also read the notes_ page, as the problem you 
are experiencing may be listed there.  Generally, the items on the notes_ page 
are not so much problems or bugs as they are an explanation of the behavior 
of paella, what to expect, and what's required when using it.  There may be a 
couple of items on the notes_ page that could be considered problems, but I'm 
not listing them here, until I can determine a good course of action to resolve 
them.  I welcome input on what should be done about both the items here and on 
the notes_ page.

-------------------------------------------------------
The gui needs more work
-------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of unimplemented features in the gui.  There are also features 
that don't work appropriately.

Template Editor
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The simple template editor may have problems in some desktop environments.  When 
some text is selected, and you right-click the mouse, the selection may disappear.  I 
have not seen this happen in a gnome or kde desktop environment, but I have experienced 
this in xfce and lxde environments.  I have not yet figured out what to do about this problem.  
**Update**  I've noticed that this mainly happens while running the paella-management 
application from within virtualbox, so perhaps the bug lies there.

Templates with "%" in the filename
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There seem to be problems when accessing templates that have a "%" character 
present in the path of the template.  This problem has been noticed while trying to 
modify gconf xml files.  Presumably, this problem can be easily fixed by proper 
escaping of the "%" character, but I don't know how to do this yet, at least without an 
ugly hack.

Delete Trait Variables
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There is currently no way to delete variables from a trait with the gui.  You will have to 
use either plain sql or another database gui (like TOra_) to delete trait variables.  This 
is not a problem when managing variables in profiles, families, or machines.

Machine Manager
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The machine manager is still somewhat new.  Most of the dialogs are just simple 
text entry dialogs, instead of having a list to select the entry from.  More appropriate 
dialogs should be added in the future.


--------------------------------------------------
Schema Problems
--------------------------------------------------

  - templates in the traits are tied to packages **fixed**

  - current_environment should look more like default_environment

    + changing this will require some changes to the code.  Either the
      changes will be extensive, or they will be minor, and scattered throughout
      the code.


----------------------------------------------------
Circular Dependencies
----------------------------------------------------

  - The traits, families, and machines all have parents, and there is
    no code to check on whether there is a circular relationship among
    these entities.  Fixing this problem is a low priority for me.  The 
    administrator who makes the paella database should be aware of 
    how the entities relate to each other.  If there are times when the
    install or parts of the management interface seem to stall, and
    there's a python process using all the cpu, this is probably the reason.  
    I'm open to accepting patches from people who wish to have this 
    problem fixed, especially since it might become more difficult to tell 
    that a circular dependency exists as the database grows in size and 
    complexity.  These problems can probably be easily fixed by using 
    the kjbuckets graph class that's already being used in paella.  I just 
    haven't gotten around to doing this, and probably won't until I start
    experiencing problems here.

    
  - Due to the way the variables are substituted, there is also the chance
    that a circular dependency can occur here.  This problem will be harder 
    to detect, and therefore, harder to prevent in the code.  Also, as the 
    database increases in size and complexity, it's more likely that a 
    circular dependency will happen here, rather than in the objects above.  
    I'm open to suggestions on how this problem can be both spotted and 
    fixed.


----------------------------------------------------
Apt Sources
----------------------------------------------------

The way apt sources are handled by the installer is not the very flexible.  Only the 
http method is handled by paella, and for the install, all of the packages must come 
from a single host.  It is probably possible to overcome this by using the hook scripts 
to create the apt sources yourself, but this is still not tested.

Also, for every apt source listed in a suite, the installer will place both deb and 
deb-src entries into the sources.list file.  In some cases this is not desirable 
and you may need to make your own scripts to handle the apt sources.  You 
can do this by making machine scripts for **apt_sources_installer** and 
**apt_sources_final** in a machine and have all machines that need this 
to depend on that machine.

----------------------------------------------------
Man Pages
----------------------------------------------------

There are no man pages for the scripts that are invoked in the shell.  In the past, 
I've not been interested in learning yet another document format, so I haven't 
bothered with man pages.

Recently, it's come to my attention that rst2man has been uploaded to unstable, so 
there will likely be manpages created when I start building paella against squeeze.
