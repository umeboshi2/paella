This is a trait to help create a self-signed certificate that all ssl enabled programs can use.  This trait is empty now, as debian has been working on a similar idea to consolidate the certificates generated by the all the various applications that use ssl.
In the future this trait will make use of debian's solution to this problem.

<b>TODO</b>
<ul>
<li>Default snakeoil generation won't work without FQDN. <b>Fixed:</b>  We now use the hostname and domain from paella to configure the snakeoil certificate.  The make-ssl-cert script leaves a dangling symlink when forcing an overwrite of the snakeoil certificate.</li>
<li>Make a template for a self-signed certificate</li>
</ul>
