Packages for a mail server.  Currently the list of packages corresponds to the "mail server" task, and differs from previous incarnations of the mailserver trait in paella.

<b>Notes:</b>

<ul>
<li>exim4: should already be included in base.</li>
<li>exim4-config: should already be included in base.</li>
<li>exim4-daemon-light: This is a good default, should possibly use a variable to determine this, an use a script to install the appropriate daemon package.</li>
<li>mailagent:  I don't know what this is.</li>
<li>mailx:  I've never used this.</li>
<li>mutt:  should already be included in base.</li>
<li>procmail:  This may be handy to help filter mail.</li>
<li>qpopper:  POP3 daemon.  I suppose this will work better than the UW-POP package.</li>
<li>sa-exim:  A tool to use spamassassin with exim.</li>
<li>spamassassin: Probably the best spam filter around.</li>
<li>uw-imapd:  IMAP server.</li>
</ul>
