In order to get paella to work properly, many things must be setup.

You need a machine that will be a webserver (for apt and debootstrap).
You need a machine with around 20~40GB of free space.  This is dependant on
how many suites you want to keep in the repository, and if you want to use the
paella mirroring scripts.  As of now the mirroring scripts grab everything out of the
Packages or Sources files (or both), and maintain a full (i386) mirror based on the contents.

If you would like to have only partial mirrors by using apt-move or something similar,
the resulting mirror MUST work with debootstrap on the suites/dists that you mirror.
I used to use apt-move to keep partial mirrors, but I had a difficult time using debootstrap
with those mirrors, because apt-move wouldn't mirror Release files or something like that.
This might be fixed by now, as it was quite some time ago that I set the mirroring up.

On the machine that the debian mirror resides is where the paella-debrepos package should
be installed.  The debrepos package doesn't currently setup the user, so you will need to

adduser --system debrepos --no-create-home --home $debian_root

where debian_root is the root of your mirror.

as the debrepos user create $debian_root/local
this will be the local repository.  The debrepos package does setup init scripts for mini-dinstall,
which it depends on.  mini-dinstall is run as the debrepos user, and the debrepos package has
a default config for it.
Currently paella uses these suite attributes -- local and common.
common is a repository for packages shared between suites, like documents and themes.
common is in $debian_root/local/common

local is a repository specifcally for that suite.
local is in $debian_root/local/$suite
