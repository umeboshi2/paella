==========

A basic skeleton for a project serving static resources

create app to serve static resources for website

only client side code and other static resources

index.html is for static sites, otherwise these are static resources for another service

index.local.html is for pre-optimized code

use python and templates (maybe mako) to make generic skeleton

add fontawesome to index page
