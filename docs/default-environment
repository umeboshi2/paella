Introduction

This document will explain the sections and options in the default environment.

Installer Section
-------------------

[installer]

- **allow_unauthenticated_packages**:  This option tells apt to refrain from authenticating
  the Release file from the debian mirror.  It's highly recommended that you leave this option 
  set to False and sign your mirrors with a key.  This option is likely to be removed at some 
  point in the future, in favor of setting the option in **apt_command_opts**.

- **apt_command**:  This is the command that will be used to install and remove packages.  
  If this is set to "aptitude", the packages that are installed will be marked with user-tags that
  correspond to the trait that installed those packages.  **Warning**:  Currently there is a 
  bug in aptitude that impedes the ability to install packages automatically.  Aptitude will always 
  return a 0 whether the command was successful or not.  This is an insidious bug that could 
  possibly insnare you when you least expect it.  Using aptitude, and not paying close attention 
  to the install log can leave your newly installed system in an undesirable state, as you may be 
  missing a few packages that you really need.   It is recommended, when you are 
  testing new configurations and installs, that you set this variable to "apt-get".  This will help
  spot errors in the install.  Once you are sure that the configuration is correct, you can then 
  switch it back to "aptitude".  If you use aptitude, be sure to keep an eye on the installer's log 
  file, as you will be able to spot an error more easily.  **Note**:  If in doubt, leaving this option 
  blank will cause the code to default to apt-get.

- **apt_command_opts**:  These are options that will be passed to the apt_command 
  listed above.  By default, this variable is empty.  Adding "--allow-unauthenticated"(apt-get) or 
  "--allow-untrusted"(aptitude)  here will override the "allow_unauthenticated_packages" 
  setting described above.

- **archive_keys**:  This is a comma separated list of key names that paella will feed to
  apt-key during installation in order to authenticate locally generated debian mirrors.  These 
  are the names of the keys that are stored in the apt-key manager in the paella database.

- **base_log_directory**":  This is full path to the directory where the log file for 
  the installer will be placed.

- **bootstrap_target**:  This option, when set to True, will call debootstrap to bootstrap 
  the target system.  When this option is False, the base system will be extracted from 
  a premade tarball.  If you extract from a premade tarball, you'll have to create a
  /etc/resolv.conf file that will work early in the install process.  The code in paella may do 
  this for you one day, but until then, it's the responsibility of the paella database to run 
  the code required to build the /etc/resolv.conf (probably by copying it from the nfsroot
  system).  **Update**:  Paella now copies the /etc/resolv.conf from the installer system 
  during the "ready_base_for_install" step.  If any of your machines have a script that 
  replaces this step, it may need to implement this part.

- **bootstrap_suites**:  **DEPRECATED** This is a comma separated list of suites that 
  will be bootstrapped, and tarred up for later extraction.  This option is used by the 
  paella-setup-nfsinstaller script, and can be ignored if you use your own method to make 
  the tarballs.  **Note**:  The paella-setup-nfsinstaller script may not work and shouldn't 
  be used.  **NEW**:  There is now a new script called paella-setup-installer that will make 
  tarballs for every suite in the database, and doesn't need to read this variable.

- **default_target**:  This is the target directory where the system will be installed.  If 
  this isn't set, /tmp/target will be used.

- **devices_tarball**:  This option provides the location of the devices tarball on the installer.  
  This tarball is created with "MAKEDEV generic", and the resulting device nodes are tarred 
  up for extraction later.  This is done as a time saver, since the MAKEDEV script can take 
  a good bit of time to run.  This option will be kept around in case it needs to be used, but
  it's not being used anymore, since much of the device creation is done by the udev program.

- **disk_log_directory**:  This is the directory where the files that setup-storage creates 
  will be placed.  Usually this is a subdirectory of the base_log_directory.  The full path to 
  the directory needs to be specified.

- **http_mirror**:  This is the url to the debian mirror that will be used to install the target 
  system.  This is probably a bad name for the variable, and it is likely to be deprecated in 
  the future (once I figure out a better name).

- **keep_installed_packages**:  This option, when set to True, will keep the downloaded 
  packages in /var/cache/apt/archives .  When the option is False, the packages will be 
  deleted at the end of each trait process.

- **trait_processes**:  This option determines the processes that will be run for each 
  trait during the install process.  This can be useful if you only want to install the packages 
  and skip the installation of templates, packages, or skip the running of scripts during the 
  install process.  Since this is a default option, any machine being installed will follow this 
  behaviour, so this is mostly useful for testing and maintainence purposes.  Eventually, 
  the trait processes may be set on a per machine, profile, or even trait level, allowing more 
  control over the installation of specific machines.  The default processes are:  pre, preseed, 
  remove, install, templates, config, chroot, reconfig, and post.

- **suite_storage**:  This option provides the location of the debootstrapped suite tarballs.  
  The tarballs provide a convenient way of speeding the installation without having to have the 
  installer run debootstrap for each install.

- **use_devices_tarball**:  This option is meaningless now, but in case it isn't, it should
  be set to False.  The udev package (and kernels) have improved a lot since sarge, and 
  this option may never have to be used again.


Machines Section
------------------------

[machines]

All the options in this section are of the form::

    hwaddr_11_22_33_44_55_66:     machinename

The option is and encoded representation of a mac address, and the value is
the name of a machine.  The paella installer uses this section to figure out 
which machine to install.


Auto Install Section
------------------------

[autoinstall]

All the options in this section are of the form::

    machinename:   True (or False)

Once the paella installer identifies the machine from the entry in the 
machines section, it uses the autoinstall section to decide whether to
install or not.  You can always install the machine manually by typing
(as root)::

    paella-machine-installer install machinename /tmp/target 

I've historically used /tmp/target as the target directory since the paella 
installer used to run from a read-only nfs mount.  With debianlive this
is not necessary anymore.
