Introduction
----------------------

This document will explain the sections and options in the default environment.

Installer Section
-------------------

- allow_unauthenticated_packages:  This option tells apt to refrain from authenticating
  the Release file from the debian mirror.

- archive_keys:  This is a comma separated list of key names that paella will feed to
  apt-key during installation in order to authenticate locally generated debian mirrors.

- bootstrap_target:  This option, when set to True, will call debootstrap to bootstrap 
  the target system.  When this option is False, the base system will be extracted from 
  a premade tarball.

- bootstrap_suites:  This is a comma separated list of suites that will be bootstrapped, 
  and tarred up for later extraction.

- devices_tarball:  This option provides the location of the devices tarball on the installer.  
  This tarball is created with "MAKEDEV generic", and the resulting device nodes are tarred 
  up for extraction later.  This is done as a time saver, since the MAKEDEV script can take 
  a good bit of time to run.

- http_mirror:  This is the url to the debian mirror that will be used to install the target 
  system.

- keep_installed_packages:  This option, when set to True, will keep the downloaded 
  packages in /var/cache/apt/archives .  When the option is False, the packages will be 
  deleted at the end of each trait process.

- suite_storage:  This option provides the location of the suite tarballs.

- use_devices_tarball:  This option is meaningless now, but in case it isn't, it should
  be set to False
