=======================================================
Guide to using the Paella Management Interface
=======================================================
.. contents:: :backlinks: entry

Introduction
--------------------------------

The management interface was developed to be a convenient way to
access and manipulate objects in the database.  The interface is not 
entirely intuitive and diverges from the way most interfaces both look 
and behave.  This was done, not to confuse the user, but to get something 
up and running quickly.  Graphical user interfaces can take a long time to 
develop, as the developer has to write a lot of supporting code to go along 
with the widgets.  This can be quite time consuming, and keeps the developer 
from being able to concentrate on some of the more functional aspects of the 
interface.  This means that the gui is lacking in buttons, icons, tooltips, and 
standard menu entries.  This does not mean that the gui is unable to be used, 
but it will take some time to get used to how things work.

It has been my desire to get as much functionality up and running before 
getting the interface to conform to more conventional standards.  At the 
moment, most of the necessary functionality is present, and only the less 
used (or presumably less used) parts are unimplemented.  Notably the 
import and export routines for the individual components aren't implemented 
yet.  To compensate, there are command line tools to handle this; paella-import 
and paella-export.  Importing and exporting a complete database is supported 
in the gui, although the progress bars on the status dialogs aren't very 
accurate.


Paella Main Menu Window
---------------------------------------

The main menu window is a small window that is used to access the other widgets in 
the manager.  The main view is a list view that lists some of the available  widgets.  
Simply selecting one of the list items will open up one of the widgets, unless the item 
has child items.  The list items that have children are differs, environ, and suites.  
The rest of the widgets can be opened with the menubar at the top of the window.

Main Menu
----------------------------------

I will begin by discussing the widgets that can be accessed from the "Main" menu 
on the top menu bar.


Manage Apt Sources
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This widget will let you add new apt sources to the database, to be used 
in the suites.  To add a new apt source, select an apt source from the 
list on the left, and press the "New" button on the toolbar.  The dialog 
will contain the values of the apt source that you selected.  Modify the 
text entries as you need for the new apt source.  You will be able to 
use this new apt source when you make a new suite.

At the moment, there is no ability to update the apt sources, remove 
apt sources, or to change the apt sources for a suite.  Some of this 
functionality is planned for the future, but at a moderate to low priority.


Open Suite Manager
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This widget will allow you to make new suites.  Use the new button on the 
toolbar to create a new suite.  A dialog window will appear, where the name 
of the new suite should be placed.  Once the name is set, another dialog will 
appear that will let you select the apt sources for that suite.  The apt sources 
are listed by name in the dialog, and the order of the selected apt sources will 
be the order that they will appear in the /etc/apt/sources.list file on installed 
systems.

Manage Apt Keys
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This widget is a new widget to help manage gpg keys that are used to sign the 
debian archives.  At the moment, the only function is to add a new key to the 
database, and this must be done by copying, and pasting the gpg public key 
into a dialog window.  There is no functionality for modifying or removing keys.

It is recommended that you should use the command line programs, paella-import 
and paella-export to handle the apt keys at this time.

Database Menu
-------------------------------------------

Connect/Disconnect to/from database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Selecting connect to a database will connect you to the paella database.  A 
dialog will appear where you can fill out the information required to connect.  
The dialog will be pre-filled with values from the ~/.paellarc file.

**Note**:  If any of these environment variables are set, they will be used 
instead of the values entered into the dialog box.  You also won't be notified 
that this has occurred.  The variables are 'PAELLA_DBHOST', 'PAELLA_DBNAME', 
'PAELLA_DBPORT', and 'PAELLA_DBUSER'.  In the future, if these environment 
variables are set, the dialog will display those values and refuse to let them 
be modified.  Normally, you should use the ~/.paellarc file to store the 
database connection info, and not use the environment variables in the 
shell that you run paella-management from.

Disconnecting from the database will do that, and it will close all the open widgets 
that are using the database connection.

Import/Export Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Widgets accessed from the list view
--------------------------------------------------------

Differs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This item has children and doesn't open a widget.  Currently, the 
only available differs are for families and traits.

The differ program that's used and tested is xxdiff.  It is probably possible 
to use another graphical differ program.  This can be set in the ~/.paellarc 
config file.  The database will be updated with both the left and right side, 
depending on if they've been changed or not.  In order for the graphical 
differ to work with paella, it must be able to save the left and/or right file 
under the same filename that it was given as arguments.

In each of the differs, the button that performs the the leftmost button 
on the toolbar (and it can use a more appropriate icon).

Family Differ
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The family differ will let you "diff" the variables from two different 
families.  Each family's variables are presented as a text file that's
similar to a config file used by the python ConfigParser module.  
Each of the sections in this file correspond to traits.

Trait Differ
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The trait differ will let you diff either scripts or templates from any trait 
in any suite.  You will be presented two list views with combo boxes right 
below them.  The update buttons on the bottom will update the corresponding 
list view with the selections from the combo boxes.  



Environ
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This item has children and doesn't open a widget.  There are two 
environments that can be edited, the current environment, and the 
default environment.  The widgets simply display the rows in the 
database table, but when you need to edit the environment, the 
external editor will present the table in the form of a config file.

The import and export options are functional in both environment 
editors.  They correspond to the standard open and save actions 
that are found on most standard guis.  The file format for import 
and export is that of a config file.

Families
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The families manager is a simple widget to help manage the 
families in the database.  You can create a new family by selecting 
"New" from the menu or toolbar.  To manage a family, you can select 
one from the list on the left side of the widget.

When a family is selected from the list, an html interface to the family 
will be presented on the right side.  At the bottom of the page is a 
"delete" link, which will let you delete the family.  There are two more 
links on this page, on table headers.  The "Parents" link will let you 
assign parents to this family.  The "Variables" link will let you edit 
the variables for the family.

Editing the variables is done in an external editor, and it uses 
a config file format, where all the sections are traits.

Machines
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Manage Machines
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Manage Disk Configs
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Manage Kernels
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Profiles

This item has children and doesn't open a widget.
