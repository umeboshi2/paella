Paella Gui
============


Original gui design goals
------------------------------------

The original goals for the gui were to provide enough of an interface to the paella_ 
database to do simple operations needed to create traits and their components.  
Much of the gui was made without regard for new users, or users unfamiliar with 
the code or paella system.  Most of my time spent in developing paella has been focused
on the installer code, and in system design.  It can take a great deal of time in 
testing, troubleshooting problems and improving systems.  As a result, the gui is 
very minimalistic, and will not do all (although it will do most) necessary operations 
needed to make use of the database.

------------------

Configuration File
-------------------------

The gui uses the paellarc config files ['/etc/paellarc', '~/.paellarc'].  Most options are 
found in the management_gui section.

management_suites
	This is comma separated list of suites to manage.  There will be a
	suite manager toolbar appear for each suite.

template_profile
	This is the name of the profile to create other profiles from.  New profiles 
	will be copies of this.

client_path
	This is the path where the imports and exports of clients reside.  This is
	not crucial to the operation of paella, and will be explained elsewhere.  
	When it is explained, I'll provide a link to the explanation.

manager_pos
	This is the position on the screen of the main management window.  
	Example:  0, 480

manager_size
	This is the size of the main management window..
	Example: 150, 200

${suite}_pos
	This is the location of the suite management toolbar for that suite.
	Example: sarge_pos:  400, 0

--------------------

Gtk/Qt and Gnome/KDE
----------------------------------

There are two graphical management interfaces for paella.  One is written 
using pygtk_.  The other is written  using pykde_.  I started paella writing the 
pygtk interface, but during the end of 2004, I switched to developing with the
pykde interface.

Way back when I was using python1.5, I learned to write interfaces with pygtk.  At the 
time the qt license was not dfsg_ compatible, but gtk was.  By the time I got around 
to writing paella, I had plenty of inertia with pygtk, although there was a dfsg compatible 
qt available.

I decided to play around with pykde one day and found it a little easier than gtk.  It takes 
longer for me to write with pykde currently, because my relative exposure to when
compared to pygtk.  I am expecting that to change with time and practice. One of the 
things that attracted me to pykde is the lower level widget subclasses.  I haven't used
to much of pygnome because of it's poor widget selection, and the difficutly in using 
bonobo.  There don't seem to be many lowlevel replacements for gtk widgets that are 
gnome aware.  To be fair, at the time the pygnome docs weren't fulfilling, so I may have
missed out on something I didn't know about.  An example that I am thinking of is the 
KComboBox which is a QComboBox with text completion methods and configurable 
hotkeys.

Current State of Paella Gui
--------------------------------------

Currently, the gtk interface is being deprecated, and the kde interface is being actively 
developed.  I will be happy to help with the gtk interface if somebody else feels 
like actively maintaining it.  Any reasonable patch sent will be applied.  Some of the 
operations with this interface are deprecated and should be removed.

You still need to gtk interface to perform some of the operations.  All operations 
available on the gtk interface will be available on the kde interface, except for the 
deprecated/unused operations.

Some of the operations are only available on the kde interface.  I am not planning on 
duplicating this on the gtk interface.

Between both interfaces, most of the simple operations, and some more complex ones 
are supported.  Do not expect the gui's to be completely sufficient anytime soon.  You 
will probably at some time be forced to use psql or a generic database manager on the 
database.  A graphical database manager that I highly recommend is TOra_.  TOra is 
available on sarge.

-------------------------

Using the Gui
--------------------

At the command line type in paella-management.  This should at least pull up the main 
management window.  There are two menus on this window, database and edit.  The
database menu has options to connect, disconnect, backup and restore a database.  
Connect and disconnect are not really supported yet.  Backup and restore will backup
and restore most of the database (with the exception of the main package tables, the 
default_environment, and current_environment tables).  Using one of these menu 
options will bring up a file dialog.  Only the directory values for the fileselection are 
used.  It doesn't matter what file you select, the directory containing the file will be the
argument that is passed.

The other menu on the main management window is edit.  The options here will open 
other management windows.

The options are

**profiles**
	brings up the profile management window

**families**
	brings up the family management window

**suitemanager**
	brings up a dialog to select the suite, then brings
	up a suitemanager toolbar window

**traitmanager**
	this option is deprecated, see traits below.

**machines**
	brings up a machine toolbar window

**traits**
	brings up a traitmanager window.  This object is not
	actively developed.

**tdiff**
	brings up the template differ

**sdiff**
	brings up the script differ

**fdiff**
	brings up the family differ

**default_environment**
	brings up the default environment editor.

**clients**
	brings up the client manager

**browser**
	brings up the kde management interface
	this option will do nothing if that interface is
	not installed.
