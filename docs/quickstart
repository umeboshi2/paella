Paella Quick Start Guide
===========================
This guide is unfinished.  If you are reading this, do not expect the guide to be correct or
accurate.  This guide will not be ready to read, and the steps outlined should not be 
attempted until this paragraph is removed.

Introduction
--------------------

.. introductory comment


Paella depends on a particular type of setup to operate.  This document details how to 
bootstrap that setup, starting from the bare minimum requirements.  This guide is written 
with the goal of minimizing the requirement for the root account to setup the system.  The 
former method of working with paella, required (possibly) extensive configuring of a local 
network.  In order to effectively use paella in a "production" environment, where you are 
actually installing machines, still requires the same type of network configuration.  It is hoped 
that the method outlined here can help prepare this by using paella to generate the 
configuration that paella requires.


-------------------

Requirements
==========================

Debian Etch
------------------
It is best to start with a running debian desktop.  The upcoming etch release is
what is currently supported.  Sarge will probably not work as paella requires python 
2.4 to operate.  Using sid may work also, especially while etch is still in testing, but this 
has not been tested.

Hardware
-----------------
This quick start routine was developed and tested using a laptop with 512MB of memory,
and a 1GB swap partition.  You could probably get by with less which I will try to estimate 
later.  Most of the memory is required to run the user mode linux processes, and this can be 
adjusted by providing more swap for the user mode processes to use.


Postgresql Database
--------------------------------
A postgresql database is required to use paella.  The database server must allow tcp 
access.  A database user named "paella" must be created and allowed access to the paella 
database without authentication.  The paella user has only read access to most tables, 
although there are a couple of tables that are setup specifically for write access.

More specific instructions on configuring the database server are provided in a later section.


User Mode Linux
----------------------------------
User mode linux is used to help test paella installations  in a limited environment where it is 
not feasible to setup a network of machines.  It can be useful when testing a new configuration 
of network services on a test network without interfering with the normal network.

In order to follow most of the steps in this guide, the user-mode-linux and uml-utilities packages 
are required to be installed.  More specific instructions on configuring user-mode-linux and the 
uml-utilities package are provided in a later section.

-------------------

Setup paella from subversion
===============================================

Install Subversion
----------------------------
You will need to install subversion to setup the environment necessary to run paella.
As root::

	apt-get install subversion

Obtain the quick setup script
-----------------------------------------------
type::
	
	svn export svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk/config/scripts/paella-devel-quick-setup

This file should already be executable, if not, do chmod +x paella-devel-quick-setup.

You should edit the file and change the variables at the top to your needs.  When you are
ready, run the script, install the packages, and make the changes to your .bashrc .  If you 
don't want to make the changes to your .bashrc, you can put the lines in another file that 
you will have to source before running any of the scripts.  There is such a file, called 
paella_environment that is created for you when you run the script.

If you change any of the variables, make a copy of the script first. Keep in mind that throughout 
this guide I will be referencing things according to the default configuration provided.

-------------------------------

Build paella packages from source tree
===============================================
You may wish to go ahead and build debian packages from the source tree.  If you do this, you 
will also have to build the useless_ packages.  Going this route has the advantage of keeping 
you from having possibly modify your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables


------------------------

Setup Database Server
=====================
Paella is developed and used with postgresql version 7.x .  It may work with newer versions, but 
it is not tested.  It is recommended that you run the database server on a host on your local 
network instead of the host you'll be using paella on.  This is not necessary, but it does help 
the performance quite a bit.

If you are new to using postgresql, I suggest reading 
/usr/share/doc/postgresql-7.4/README.Debian.gz first.


	Steps to setup paella database::
		
		apt-get install postgresql
		su postgres
		createuser -a -d adminuser
		createuser -A -D paella
		exit

Next, you will have to edit a couple of configuration files as the postgres user.

Edit postgresql.conf
------------------------------
You will probably have to edit /etc/postgresql/7.4/main/postgresql.conf , and
set "tcpip_socket = true" .

Edit pg_hba.conf
--------------------------
You will have to edit /etc/postgresql/7.4/main/pg_hba.conf, and add some lines:

If your database server is not on your desktop, but on the local network, you
will have to allow access to the paella database from your machine.
example::

	#TYPE	DATABASE	USER		IP-ADDRESS	IP-MASK		METHOD
	host	paella		paella		<my ip address>	255.255.255.255	trust
	host	paella		dbadmin		<my ip address>	255.255.255.255	ident sameuser

If your database server is on your desktop, you need to allow access from your uml network.
example::

	#TYPE	DATABASE	USER		IP-ADDRESS	IP-MASK		METHOD
	host	paella		paella		10.0.1.0		255.255.255.0	trust
	host	paella		dbadmin		10.0.1.1		255.255.255.0	trust


There is no real authentication support, except for limited password support.  There has not 
been enough reason to pursue this yet, as the database is always either developed or used in 
a trusted environment.

dbusers

Setup User Mode Linux
======================

Install packages
--------------------------
First off, you will need to get root and install a couple of packages::

      apt-get install user-mode-linux uml-utilities


Configure TAP Network
---------------------------------------
Be sure to read /usr/share/doc/uml-utilities/README.Debian, and follow the instructions 
there to setup the tap network.  

This quick start procedure uses the 10.0.1.0 network for the user-mode-linux machines by 
default.  Here is what to add to /etc/network/interfaces::

	       auto tap0
	       iface tap0 inet static
		     address 10.0.1.1
		     netmask 255.255.255.0
		     tunctl_user uml-net


You will probably want to add yourself to the uml-net group::

	 adduser username uml-net

Masquerade TAP Network
------------------------------------------------
You will need to setup iptables to get your uml machines to access the rest of the network.
As root type::

	iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
	echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

This is assuming that eth0 is your main network interface.  You may want to add these lines
to your /etc/rc.local script.

----------

Configuration files
================================

Setup .paellarc
-------------------
.. __: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ConfigParser.html

If you used the quick setup script above, the example paellarc file will be here,
~/workspace/paella/config/share/paellarc .  You can copy this file to ~/.paellarc and edit it.
If you are not familiar with the file format, you can read about it here__ .  Options that are 
prefixed by an underscore are not referenced in the code.  You can make your own if you 
wish.

In the database section, the dbhost option should be the ip address of the tap interface you 
created in the section above.  You will probably want to change the dbusername option to
the database admin user that you created above.

You can either ignore or completely remove the installer section.  It is only needed for the
paella machine installer.  It is not needed for the user-mode-linux installer which we are 
using here.

The management_gui section has options for the paella-management application.  The options 
that you may want to change here are "text_editor", and "x_differ".  Both of these commands 
should display an X window.  For the x_differ, I highly recommend xxdiff.  The x_differ command 
line conform to this::

     x_differ LeftFile RightFile


You should not need to change any other options.

Setup .umlmachines.conf
----------------------------------------
If you used the quick setup script above, the example umlmachines config file will be here, 
~/workspace/paella/config/share/umlmachines.  If you built packages, install the 
paella-uml-admin package, and you will find the file at 
/usr/share/doc/paella-uml-admin/examples/umlmachines.conf .  You can copy this 
file to ~/.umlmachines.conf and edit it.  The file format is the same as the paellarc file.  
Reading through this file can give you a good idea of how the paella uml system works.

The top of the file is where most of the paths are defined.  You shouldn't have to change these 
if you are using the quick setup script, although you will probably need to modify the 
**uml_initscript** option to point to the correct location of the paella-init file.  This 
is the option with the value "%(_script_path)s/paella-init" .


If you are not using the default tap network described above, you will have to modify the uml 
network options accordingly.


You may want to modify the **bootstrap_debmirror** option in the 
`umlmachines` section.

----------------

Using paella-management
=======================================
You should be ready to use the paella-management PyKDE interface now.  Before running 
the application, check the **management_gui** section of your ~/.paellarc file, 
and make sure that both the **text_editor** and **x_differ** options 
are set to applications that exist on your system and work in X windows.

Start paella-management
------------------------------
Run the paella-management script to start the management interface.  The first thing that you 
will want to do is to connect to the database.  There is a connect button on the toolbar for you 
to press.  The connection dialog entries are taken from your ~/.paellarc file.

Once you connect to the database, you should get a dialog asking to create the primary 
tables.  You should click yes here to setup an empty database structure.  If you don't do 
this, the database import procedure will create these tables for you, but you won't be able to
use the paella-management interface until you do this.

Import stage1 database
--------------------------
Now we are going to import the startup database.  You will need an internet connection to 
import the database.  The importer downloads the Packages files from the debian mirror in 
the database.xml file, and inserts them into the database.  Go to the menubar, and in the 
database menu, select "import database".  A directory selection dialog will appear.  You 
need to select the "stage1" directory.  Note that the default debian mirror is 
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian .  If you need to change this, edit the database.xml file
in the stage1 directory, and alter the uri attribute to the aptsource xml element at the 
top of the file.  You can change this to a local mirror if you already have one.  Paella has only 
been tested with http apt sources, it's behaviour on other methods is unknown.

      If you are working from a subversion copy from the quick setup script, the directory
      you will want to select is here, ~/workspace/paella/config/share/databases/stage1/ .

If everything is working, you should be seeing an ugly little progress dialog displaying 
something resembling what it should be doing.  The packages will probably take a little 
while to insert.  The apt_source_packages table can take a lot of space that could be
better saved.  In the future, it will probably default to only holding package names rather 
than the other attributes in the Packages file.  The reason they are there is to help keep the 
automated installations from bombing due to unavailable or misspelled packages.


After importing the database, you will have to disconnect and then reconnect to the 
database to refresh the available widgets in the paella-management application.  You may  
wish to restart the application instead, as when an import occurs, a lot of memory is used 
to parse the Packages file, and insert the packages into the database.  This memory is not 
freed after the import process.  Fixing this has not been a major goal, as imports are fairly 
rare during the normal use of paella-management.


Configure stage1 database
-------------------------------------------
There should be very little effort needed to configure the stage1 database.
Check default environment.
Check tap_network family.
Check uml_startup family.

------------------

Install the UML Machines
======================================
Now we should be ready to install the uml machines.  The uml installer is currently limited to 
installing one machine at a time.  This is due to the default configuration for this quickstart 
guide using a static ip.  This can be easily changed later if you wish to use the uml installer 
for testing purposes.

Install uml_head
-------------------------
type::

	paella-umlrunner install uml_head

Install umlbuilder
------------------------
type::

	paella-umlrunner install umlbuilder



Running the UML Machines
======================================
Now we should be ready to start running the uml machines.

Run uml_head
-------------------------
Make sure your umask is set to 022.

type::

	paella-umlrunner run uml_head

Login as root.  There should be no password required.
type::

	./setup_debrepos

This will run a script that will setup a partial debian mirror.  This is to keep from 
having to use a full debian mirror, that used to be required previously to use paella.  This 
partial mirror should be under 400MB in size.


Run umlbuilder
------------------------
type::

	paella-umlrunner run umlbuilder

Login as root.  There should be no password required.
type::

	./init_pbuilder

This will run a script that will prepare pbuilder to build the paella and useless packages.  
Basically it either generates or restores the base.tgz for pbuilder.  The base.tgz is copied to 
the hostfs mount, in case it is needed in the future.  Once the script finishes, the next step 
is to get the useless and paella packages built.  There is a script that does this too.
type::

	./build_paella_from_subversion

This script will checkout the sources from subversion.  It then exports the working copies and 
uses pbuilder to build the exports.  Once the packages are built, they are uploaded to 
the uml_head machine, and placed in the debian mirror.



.. scavenge, then trash what remains below


Getting started with paella (outdated)
===============================================

People who will get the most benefit out of paella are IT consultants that manage
multiple disjoint networks.  You may also benefit from it if your network is large enough,
and you have mostly debian machines on it.  If you only maintain one network with a few
machines, e.g. a firewall, a server, and a couple of desktops, the time involved it setting up
paella and maintaining configurations might probably be more than just using more simple
backup and restore methods.

There are currently no real releases of paella, because i dislike the file release system at
berlios, so you will have to check out the code via subversion, or alternately you can grab
the debian packages from http://gregscomputerservice.com.  The line for the sources.list
is 'deb http://gregscomputerservice.com/debian/local common/'.

A person who uses paella is expected to understand how to perform basic system 
administration on a debian system.  They should also be comfortable with building their
own debian packages from source, and debianizing a generic source application.  Paella 
makes use of mini-dinstall to maintain a local mini-repository and can install systems that 
reference that repository.  This provides a fairly simple way to add custom packages to the 
systems that you will be designing.

If you feel that you may benefit out of paella, here is how to get started.  If you don't want to
use the apt source above, you can check it out from subversion at berlios.  Paella
depends on Useless.  Useless is a collection of python modules that I use in other database 
applications.

to get useless:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/useless/trunk useless

to get paella:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk paella

You can build the packages with debuild, or fakeroot debian/rules binary.


--------------------------------------

Hardware Recommendations
------------------------------------------

Since the paella-nfsinstaller runs on a nfsroot, it is necessary to have some sort of network 
to support this.  Paella works best with at least one dedicated server and a management 
desktop, both running debian.  

Server:

The server will be responsible for running the nfs-server, the boot-server, the postgresql 
server, and the webserver. It is recommended that you have a local mirror of a debian 
repository on the server, and have it accessible over http.  You should also install the 
paella-debrepos package on this machine to create and maintain your custom debian 
repository.

	Database Setup::
		
		apt-get install postgresql
		su postgres
		createuser -a -d adminuser
		createuser -A -D paella
		createlang plpgsql template1	
		exit
		su adminuser createdb paella

You should setup /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf to allow access to the database by
paella from anywhere on the local network, and allow adminuser from your management
desktop.

The setup of the boot-server and the nfs-server are beyond the scope of this 
document, but the profiles are defined in the default database provided with paella.  So 
instead of taking the time to setup the boot-server and nfs-server manually, you can use the 
paella-chroot-install script to create the machine and tar it up.

Desktop:

The desktop should be about 400MHz Pentium or better with >= 1024x768 resolution, 
capable of running kde.  It is necessary to have access to your database on the server.  You
should also have your EDITOR environment variable set to something that will pop-up 
a window in X.  On this machine you will want to install the paella-admin and the 
paella-defaultdb packages.  The default config file is located at /etc/paellarc.  You will
probably want to copy this to ~/.paellarc and edit it.


-----------------------------------

Local Debian Repository
------------------------------------

Paella is built to make use of you local debian repository.  The paella-debrepos package 
uses (and depends on) mini-dinstall.  If you haven't used mini-dinstall, you should review 
the documentation for it.  Install the paella-debrepos package on the server.  The init script 
should fail because you are likely not to have a debrepos user.  This will be fixed later.  
Anyway, in the root of the debian mirror, there needs to be a 'local' directory.  The 
mini-dinstall daemon will be run from here. In the 'local' directory there needs to be a 
directory for each suite you have in paella, plus one called 'common'.

------------------------------------

Using Paella-Management
-------------------------------------

The management interface is going through changes.  Paella started with a gtk interface, 
and as time passed, the qt/kde toolkit started looking more appealing.  As a result, the
gtk interface works, but it is sloppy, and not going to be fixed.  The kde interface won't do 
very much right now, but bugs will be fixed on it.  A good portion of setting up and 
configuring the machines is done with the gtk interface, so for the time being, anybody 
using paella will have to bear through using it until the kde interface is ready.
