Local Debian Repository
------------------------------------

In order to get the best use from paella, it is likely that you will need to have 
your own repository of locally built packages and a mirror of the official 
debian repository.  The mirror can be a partial mirror.

There used to be a package distributed with paella that helped with making 
a mirror and keeping a repository of locally built packages, but this has been 
made obsolete by packages like debmirror and reprepro.  If you choose to use 
debmirror to mirror the debian repository, you will still need another program 
to help manage packages made locally.  The debarchiver package is a 
good choice here.  I used to use mini-dinstall for this, but I found that debarchiver 
does a better job on creating the archive format.

I am using reprepro to handle this, since it will both mirror the official repository 
and you can add packages that you build to it.  It also uses the pool structure, 
signs the Release files, and can make partial mirrors.  Using reprepro is 
highly recommended.
