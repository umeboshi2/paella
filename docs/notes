What is Paella
--------------------

.. small overview of paella

Paella is a installation/configuration management system centered on 
being able to easily define, configure, maintain and update systems and 
networks.


-----------------------------------

Getting started with paella
=============================

People who will get the most benefit out of paella are IT consultants that manage
multiple disjoint networks.  You may also benefit from it if your network is large enough,
and you have mostly debian machines on it.  If you only maintain one network with a few
machines, e.g. a firewall, a server, and a couple of desktops, the time involved it setting up
paella and maintaining configurations might probably be more than just using more simple
backup and restore methods.

There are currently no real releases of paella, because i dislike the file release system at
berlios, so you will have to check out the code via subversion, or alternately you can grab
the debian packages from http://gregscomputerservice.com.  The line for the sources.list
is 'deb http://gregscomputerservice.com/debian/local common/'.

A person who uses paella is expected to understand how to perform basic system 
administration on a debian system.  They should also be comfortable with building their
own debian packages from source, and debianizing a generic source application.  Paella 
makes use of mini-dinstall to maintain a local mini-repository and can install systems that 
reference that repository.  This provides a fairly simple way to add custom packages to the 
systems that you will be designing.

If you feel that you may benefit out of paella, here is how to get started.  If you don't want to
use the apt source above, you can check it out from subversion at berlios.  Paella
depends on Useless.  Useless is a collection of python modules that I use in other database 
applications.

to get useless:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/useless/trunk useless

to get paella:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk paella

You can build the packages with debuild, or fakeroot debian/rules binary.


--------------------------------------

Hardware Recommendations
------------------------------------------

Since the paella-nfsinstaller runs on a nfsroot, it is necessary to have some sort of network 
to support this.  Paella works best with at least one dedicated server and a management 
desktop, both running debian.  

Server:

The server will be responsible for running the nfs-server, the boot-server, the postgresql 
server, and the webserver. It is recommended that you have a local mirror of a debian 
repository on the server, and have it accessible over http.  You should also install the 
paella-debrepos package on this machine to create and maintain your custom debian 
repository.

	Database Setup::
		
		apt-get install postgresql
		su postgres
		createuser -a -d adminuser
		createuser -A -D paella
		createlang plpgsql template1	
		exit
		su adminuser createdb paella

You should setup /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf to allow access to the database by
paella from anywhere on the local network, and allow adminuser from your management
desktop.

The setup of the boot-server and the nfs-server are beyond the scope of this 
document, but the profiles are defined in the default database provided with paella.  So 
instead of taking the time to setup the boot-server and nfs-server manually, you can use the 
paella-chroot-install script to create the machine and tar it up.

Desktop:

The desktop should be about 400MHz Pentium or better with >= 1024x768 resolution, 
capable of running kde.  It is necessary to have access to your database on the server.  You
should also have your EDITOR environment variable set to something that will pop-up 
a window in X.  On this machine you will want to install the paella-admin and the 
paella-defaultdb packages.  The default config file is located at /etc/paellarc.  You will
probably want to copy this to ~/.paellarc and edit it.


-----------------------------------

Local Debian Repository
------------------------------------

Paella is built to make use of you local debian repository.  The paella-debrepos package 
uses (and depends on) mini-dinstall.  If you haven't used mini-dinstall, you should review 
the documentation for it.  Install the paella-debrepos package on the server.  The init script 
should fail because you are likely not to have a debrepos user.  This will be fixed later.  
Anyway, in the root of the debian mirror, there needs to be a 'local' directory.  The 
mini-dinstall daemon will be run from here. In the 'local' directory there needs to be a 
directory for each suite you have in paella, plus one called 'common'.

------------------------------------

Using Paella-Management
-------------------------------------

The management interface is going through changes.  Paella started with a gtk interface, 
and as time passed, the qt/kde toolkit started looking more appealing.  As a result, the
gtk interface works, but it is sloppy, and not going to be fixed.  The kde interface won't do 
very much right now, but bugs will be fixed on it.  A good portion of setting up and 
configuring the machines is done with the gtk interface, so for the time being, anybody 
using paella will have to bear through using it until the kde interface is ready.
