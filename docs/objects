Objects and Definitions
==========================

Apt Source
------------------
An apt source is similar to a line in an /etc/apt/sources.list file.


Suite
-------
A suite is a similiar to debian suites like woody or sarge.  A suite 
can be used to make different versions of configurations, or different
styles of design and configurations.  Traits are held in suites.

Basically a suite is an ordered list of apt sources, and a set of traits.


Trait 
------
A trait is the atomic unit that signifies a feature. 
A trait belongs to a suite.  The table in the database that holds the list of traits
is called $(suite)_traits.  A trait can have packages, parents, templates, scripts 
and a set of variables.

- **parents**

  + no trait can be processed during the installation before all
    of its parents are processed.	     
  + parents are not required, but most traits should depend on a default
    trait.
  + no trait can be processed during the installation before all of its
    parents are processed. 
    
  
- **packages**

  + this is a list of packages to install or remove 
    - although other options are available, only install and remove are supported now 
  + packages are not required 
 
- **templates** 

  + templates can have simple tags for variable substitution 
  + templates store user/group and chmod permissions 
  + a template must currently be attached to a package 
    
    - this feature should be removed, because traits that only need 
      traits get vestigial packages assigned to them like base-files, 
      initscripts, or bash 
  + currently the var/cache/debconf/config.dat template is reserved 
    for debconf 

- **environment** 

  + a collection of name, value pairs for use in the templates and scripts 
  + a trait's environment contains its parents' environment 
  + a big python dictionary is made of the environment where the keys
      are formed as "trait_name" where trait is the trait and name is the 
      name of the variable.

- **scripts** 

  + a trait is not required to have a script 
  + only three types of scripts are currently supported, pre, post, and chroot 

    - chroot is a special script that is run in a chrooted environment in the target area. 
      This script should be aware of what's on the target system and only depend on 
      those things. The script shouldn't connect to paella or depend on other installation 
      tools not present in the target system. 
    - pre is executed before anything else is processed in the trait. 

      + The pre script is executed with an os.system. 

    - post is the very last action to perform in the trait 

      + post should be able to talk to database and environment 

  + other scripts
    
    - you can define a script for any
      step in the trait install process.

    - if you make a script named install, remove, config,
      or reconfig, that step in the trait process is ignored,
      and the script run instead.  The script doesn't have
      to do anything, so it's a good way to skip a step in the 
      trait installation

    - in order for a script to be executed its name must match
      a step in the trait processes.

Family
--------

- A family is a collection of variables from different traits 

  + a family can have parents
  + a family is not tied to a suite
  + a variable in a family doesn't have to exist in a trait,
    but it has to be tied to a trait.

Profile
-------

- A profile is a collection of traits, and an environment

  + Traits - the traits listed in the profile are ordered 
  + Families - an unordered list of families 
  + Environment
	- the profile environment overrides the trait environments 
	  and the family environment 


Machine Database
=================
This section describes the machine database part of paella.  Profile, traits, and families
should not be machine specific.  The Machine database trying to be design to hold
information about physical systems to install logical systems from.

Machine
--------

a machine contains 

- a **name**

- a **parent** - This is a parent machine that current machine is based from.

  + Unlike traits and families, a machine can only have one parent.

  + This is an optional field.

- a **kernel** 
  
  + A kernel is simply the name of a kernel image package (for example, 
    linux-image-2.6-686).
  + The package must be install-able by apt, in a chroot environment, on the target system. 
  + This attribute must be set somewhere in the machine's ancestry.

- a **diskconfig** 
  
  + a diskconfig is the name of a diskconfig file that will be used by setup-storage when
    during the setup_disks part of the install.
  + This attribute must be set somewhere in the machine's ancestry.

- a **profile** - This is the profile that will be installed on the machine.

  + This attribute must be set somewhere in the machine's ancestry.

- **families** - These are the normal families in the paella database.  These families
  override the families in the profile.

- **scripts** - These are "hook" scripts to override steps in the install process.

- **variables** - These are variables that will override the variables defined in the 
  traits, families, profile, and families for the machine.  In other words, these are the
  variables that override all other variables.

Machine Inheritance
-------------------------------------------

Since machines can have parents, it's important to know how a parent affects the
machine.  There are three main attributes that each machine has.  These are the
kernel, profile, and diskconfig attributes.  If the child machine doesn't have one of 
these attributes set, it is resolved by going up the ancestral chain until the attribute 
is found.  So a kernel set on a parent machine will be installed on all the child machines, 
unless one of the child machines has their kernel attribute set, which will override the
parent machine's kernel.  This allows the administrator to make groups of machines 
by using a parent, setting the attributes on the parent, and leaving them as NULL on the 
children.

Machine scripts are treated similarly to the attributes mentioned above.  A script set 
on a parent machine will be run on each of the child machines, unless the child has 
that script set itself.  There is currently not a way to tell a child machine to ignore a 
parent's script and perform the regular step in the paella installer.


Families and variables are done differently.  Here, the variables are resolved from 
"oldest" to "youngest".  Each machine updates the variables with its families, then 
its own variables.  If there is a parent family on a child machine that has a child family 
on a parent machine, the parent family on the child machine will override the child 
family on the parent machine.  This is because the variables are updated one machine 
at a time from "oldest" to "youngest", families first, then variables.

I'll put some examples here later, since this section is hard to write, and probably 
even harder to read.


Machine Scripts
-------------------------------

Machine scripts correspond to steps in the install process for machines.  These steps
will be treated similiar to the trait scripts. The default steps/scripts are:

- pre

  + this step normally does nothing.

- setup_disks

  + this step is responsible for partitioning the disks and
    for creating the filesystems

- mount_target

  + this step is responsible for mounting the filesystems
    created in the previous step to the target directory

  + the script will need to make the subdirectories in target
    for filesystems under the target root, and mount the
    appropriate ones.

- bootstrap

  + this step is responsible for bootstrapping the base
    system into the target directory.

- apt_sources_installer

  + this step should create a sources.list file that is appropriate
    for the installer environment.  It should place the file in 
    $target/etc/apt/sources.list

- ready_base

  + this is a legacy step in the installer that would setup a root
    password, a simple /etc/network/interfaces file, and a fstab.

- pre_install

  + this step normally does nothing.

- install

  + this step performs the install process

- post_install

  + this step normally does nothing.

- install_modules

  + this step should create a $target/etc/modules file appropriate for
    the machine type.  This step isn't implemented anymore.  I'm leaving
    the step here as a step that does nothing now, in case a script is 
    needed to perform this function.

- install_kernel

  + this step is reponsible for installing a kernel in the target and
    preparing the bootloader for booting.

  +  the machine should be ready to reboot after this step

- apt_sources_final

  + this step is reponsible for making a sources.list that will
    be used when the machine is on the target site.  This step can be
    skipped for on-site installations.

- install_fstab

  + this step is reponsible for installing the fstab on the target system.

- post

  + this step normally does nothing.
