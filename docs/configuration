Object Names
------------------------

Generally, there are no capital letters in the names of any of the objects.  It 
is possibly ok to use capital letters, but has never been tested.  More specifically, 
all object names **should** be able to be used as python identifiers.  This means 
that they must not start with a number, or have a dash (-) in them.  This is not 
strictly enforced, and you may be able to get away with this in most circumstances.  
Even if you wish to use dashes in the names of traits, and families, you must not 
use them in variable names.  Also, you must not use colons (:) in the variable names 
either, as they are used to separate trait names and variable names in the templates 
and in the environment dictionaries.  As long as you stick to names that would be 
appropriate as python identifiers, you should be fine.

A suite cannot be named "diskconfig", "families", "machines", or "profiles".  
These names are used as directories to import and export those objects.  It's 
recommended that a suite be a one word "codename" with all lowercase letters, like 
sid, sarge, or woody, but you can also use underscores in the name.  Every suite will 
have tables in the database prefixed by the name of the suite, so this must be taken 
into account, if you want to diverge from this naming convention.







Environment Variables used by Paella
------------------------------------------------------

+ these are used to help override a configured db connection:

  - **PAELLA_DBHOST** - hostname or ip of host paella database resides

  - **PAELLA_DBNAME** - the name of the paella database

  - **PAELLA_DBPORT** - the port of the paella database (this currently
    can't be set in the gui)

  - **PAELLA_DBUSER** - the name of the database user

  - **PAELLA_DBPASSWD** - the password to the paella database.

+ These environment variables are set by the installers, and can be used
  in the scripts:

  - **PAELLA_TRAIT** - name of the trait currently being processed

  - **PAELLA_TARGET** - path to target system (/tmp/target by default)

  - **PAELLA_MACHINE** - name of the machine currently being processed

  - **PAELLA_PROFILE** - name of the profile currently being installed

  - **PAELLA_LOGFILE** - absolute name of logfile

  - **LOGFILE** -- this needs to be deprecated

  - **FAKE_START_STOP_DAEMON** - This was used in the old installer to make
    and remove the start-stop-daemon in a manner similar to debootstrap.  While the
    environment variable isn't checked anymore, the code to make and remove the
    fake start-stop-daemon is still there, and can be used in the pre and post scripts 
    of the traits that will need them most.

  - **DEBIAN_FRONTEND** - This is usually set to noninteractive by the paella 
    installer, but it is never read from the environment by paella.


+ These are used in scripts and are mostly unimportant:

  - **SUITES**

  - **USER**

  - **PATH**


------------------------------------------------


Paellarc Configuration File
------------------------------------------------

I'm trying to move as much as possible from the paellarc file to
the default environment in the database.
(installer) means that the section or option is meaningful only to the installer code.
(manager) means that the section or option is meaningful only to the db manager code.
Otherwise the section or option is applicable to both the installer and manager parts of 
paella.

+ Section **database**

  - **dbhost**:  hostname or ip of host where paella database resides

  - **dbname**:  name of paella database

  - **dbusername**:  username to connect to database with

  - **dbpassword**:  password to use for authentication (if necessary)

  - **default_path**:  default path for import and export of database data

+ Section **installer** 

  - **IMPORTANT** - this whole section is now vestigial, and the documentation
    is only being left here as a reference, in case I forget to mention something
    on the `default-environment`_ page.  Now, the installer only reads the paellarc 
    file at /etc/paellarc for the database connection.  All other information is provided 
    by the default_environment table.

  - **suite_storage**:  

    - default /var/cache/paella/suites - where the base
      tarballs are stored.

  - **bootstrap_suites**:  

    - a comma separated list of suites that will be debootstrapped and 
      tarred for later extraction during installs..

  - **use_devices_tarball**:  

    - This used to be handy as the MAKEDEV script used
      to take a long time to run.  We can now use udev to do most of the work that
      this option was here for.  This option is also vestigial, as it's now located
      in the default environment.

+ Section **management_gui** (manager)

  - This section is for using the management gui interface.

  - **template_profile**:  This is the name of the profile that will be used as a
    "template" when creating an new profile.  Default is "skeleton"

  - **client_path**:  This is the path that's used to import and export client 
    information.  At the moment, the client widget isn't functional, so
    this option is useless for the time being.

  - **client_widget**:  This option enables (or disables) the client widget.
    Default: False  
    Don't bother to enable this, as it's not yet implemented.  This is a carryover 
    from the older gtk interface.

  - **manager_type**:  This option is used to determine the type of manager
    widget that will be used for the management gui.  At the moment, only
    listbox_select is supported.  This is the widget that uses a listbox, instead
    of a menu to display widget options.  This is not how most user interfaces 
    work, but it works just fine anyway.

  - **text_editor**:  This is the text editor that's used with the management gui.  
    This command either needs to be in your PATH, or the full path to the file 
    must be used.  This command doesn't handle options, if you need to pass
    options to the editor, please use a wrapper.  The default is kwrite, but I really
    recommend xemacs.  I personally use gnuclient (xemacs) as my external 
    editor.

  - **x_differ**:  This is the graphical differ that's used with the management gui.
    This command has all the requirements of the **text_editor** option above.
    I recommend using xxdiff, which is the default.  This command must use these 
    arguments::

	x_differ leftfile rightfile

------------------------------------------------

User Mode Linux
======================

**All of the User Mode Linux functionality has been removed from paella.**

The documentation in this section is being kept for historical purposes, and 
because there may be a day when the ability to use paella to install a uml machine 
will be restored.  The code that handled installing uml machines can still be 
found in the "umlref" branch of the subversion repository.  This code is most 
likely outdated, but it can provide a reference as to how configuring and installing 
uml machines used to work and can be used to reimplement it in paella.

User mode linux is a great tool to help test paella, and installing configurations.  
However, since VT technology has come around and VM's run reasonably fast, 
maintainence of the uml related code will be a very low priority.

Uml Machine Configuration File
------------------------------------------------

This is the structure of the umlmachines.conf configuration file.
Every section in this configuration file defines a uml machine, using
the name of the section.

+ Section **DEFAULT**

  - The DEFAULT section is used to set defaults for the uml
    machines.

+ Section **umlmachines**

  - This section may be removed, and the options placed in DEFAULT

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Uml Kernel Options used by paella-init script
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the command line options understood by the paella-init for
the user mode linux kernel.

- **python_path**:  sets the PYTHONPATH

- **logfile**:  path to logfile

- **LOGFILE**:  another name for logfile

- **paella_action**:  action to be performed by paella-init

- **umlconfig**:  path to umlmachines.conf

- **umlmachine**:  name of the uml machine that being run

- **paellaprofile**:  profile to be installed if applicable

- **paellasuite**:  suite to be bootstrapped if applicable

- **paella_system_tarball**:  a system backup to be restored if applicable

- **bootstrap_script**:  path to script to run with debootstrap

- **bootstrap_mirror**:  mirror to use with debootstrap

- **backup_target**:  option used  before paella-init set the umlmachine, should
  be removed soon.

------------------------------------------------


Default Environment
======================================

.. _here: default-environment.html

The default environment is a ini type configuration file stored in the database as the
default_enviroment table.  A page describing the default enviroment can be found here_ .
