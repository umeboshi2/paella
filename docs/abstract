Paella is system for creating/installing customized debian systems.
There are no current plans for configuration updates on live systems,
that's not it's initial purpose, although it may be extended later.

Paella is still in a planning state, and the configuration ability is 
real simple right now.

Inspiration for paella comes from many places:

debconf -- an important abstract configuration system
	which is sadly not yet supported by paella (can somebody help me?)
	debconf is fully planned to be supported, i just haven't
	figured out the best way to template a debconf template
	and whether to crete a flat db, use a dir/db over nfs, or
	ldap (which sounds like the best shot, though i'm unfamiliar with it)
	paella is not a replacement for debconf.

fai -- fully automatic install
	an excellent installer, with the capability of bootstrapping
	an entire network!  paella was going to just complement fai,
	but I'm starting to prefer the configuration layout i'm planning,
	so paella will probably completely replace fai

Knoppix -- and Morphix, Gnoppix, and other live cd's
	paella will eventually be a jigdo-ish like description
	of the cd, so it will be easier to construct the cd's
	from a local repository, and modify them before creation

OpenZaurus -- and Matt Zimmerman's efforts with debian-handhelds
	building oz is a pita, i'm not used to bitkeeper and I can't
	find a specific build-root for a specific release.  It's like the 
	source is available, but not specifically per package.  Overall
	though, i have found the openzaurus cross compiling solution
	to be the most preferable way to build source for an
	embedded device.  My solution now is to use paella,
	and pbuilder (thanks, for the work in getting so many
	packages to autobuild! ;)) to define, bootstrap, and control
	cross compiling pbuilders with autobuilt toolchains.  This should
	make it easier to script autobuilds of an embedded systems,
	patches and all :)

Demudi, Debian-Lex, ...
	I think paella can be very instrumental in helping configure and
	install a custom network on a per network type basis, (i.e. what
	machines are on the network and what are there jobs, expected
	activities, etc.  I am also thinking of networks with custom configured
	roaming pda's, laptops, or whatever can take a debian system

and that is also probably the order i will be working in.

I am aware that customized packages can be made and distributed (like
tasksel and jablicator), but it is not paella's designed purpose to be used
in that manner.  Once paella is done configuring and installing, it should leave
no trace of itself.  The user should be left with a clean, customized debian 
system.  This is mainly a tool meant for somebody who is going to be creating,
configuring, and installing many debian systems.

I have tried to make a common denominator that most of these pojects share,
but seem to be missing.

My urgent need to get this system working so i can starting earning a living
with it, has caused to code to wind up a bit sloppy. Sorry.

UPDATE:
The system is working well enough to make a living with it.
The livecd idea hasn't been touched on much, though there is a description
of the process of bootstrapping a new base Knoppix cd in this tree.  There is
a script called 'setup-livecd-tree' in the script directory that can be used after
a debootstrap to setup a small livecd system (doesn't make the iso, just the
system).
