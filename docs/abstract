Paella is system for creating/installing customized debian systems.
There are no current plans for configuration updates on live systems,
that's not it's initial purpose, although it may be extended later.

Inspiration for paella comes from many places:


FAI
-------

FAI (the fully automated installer)
An excellent installer, with the capability of bootstrapping
an entire network!  paella was going to just complement fai,
ut I'm starting to prefer the configuration layout i'm planning,
so paella will probably completely replace fai.  

Much of this has been 
done, and now only the setup-storage command is being used 
from the fai-client package.  There is no need to reinvent the 
wheel here, as setting up disks can be complex and error 
proned if it's not managed right

debconf
--------------

an important abstract configuration system

Much of the inspiration for paella comes straight from both 
debconf and FAI.  I wanted to make a system that held the 
configuration for many packages in many formats and be 
able to use an automated installer to install the configuration 
onto systems.  Also, I wanted to keep the management of 
the configuration separate from the system it was being 
installed to, to keep the system from depending on paella.

Knoppix 
-------------

,,, and Morphix, Gnoppix, and other live cd's

Debian Live has made most of the live cd's obsolete, and it's 
now the preferred method of creating a live system.  It's 
planned to be able to use paella to generate the chroot directory 
hen use debian live to build the binary image.  This hasn't been
done yet, but it should not be too difficult.  Since debian live can 
make live systems on many media types, including network 
images, it's now being used for the paella installer.


Demudi, Debian-Lex, ...
----------------------------

I think paella can be very instrumental in helping configure and
install a custom network on a per network type basis, (i.e. what
machines are on the network and what are there jobs, expected
activities, etc.  I am also thinking of networks with custom configured
roaming pda's, laptops, or whatever can take a debian system.

The paragraph above was written long ago, and now there are 
custom debian distribution packages that help make this easier.  
I think that paella could still be useful here, but I have not really 
looked at the cdd package very much.  Much of the reason for 
paella's existence is to make it easier to make machines that 
are configured to perform special sets of tasks.
