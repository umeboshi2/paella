Instructions for building the packages in this directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to prepare these packages for building, you will need to 
install the devscripts package.  You will not have to have the 
build dependencies installed on the system that you prepare these
source packages on, but you will need the tools to download and 
prepare the sources to be built.  These instructions are fast and loose 
and under the impression or assumption that you are familiar with building 
debian packages from source.

Instructions for the gkrellm-skins-installer
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you are in a subversion working copy, you should export 
the gkrellm-skins-installer directory::

    svn export gkrellm-skins-installer gkrellm-skins-installer-exported

Then change to that directory::

     cd gkrellm-skins-installer(-exported)

Then prepare the source::

     uscan --force-download --rename --verbose
     dpkg-buildpackage -S

Now you should have the .orig.tar.gz, .diff.gz and .dsc files that are required to build the 
package.  Now you can run pbuilder, cowbuilder, or cowpoke on the .dsc file, or if you want 
to build against the system you are running::

   dpkg-source -x gkrellm-skins-installer_0.0-0.dsc
   cd gkrellm-skins-installer-0.0
   debuild


Instructions for the timidity-guspat-installer
-----------------------------------------------------------

Preparing this package to be built is a little bit involved, as it required two upstream tarballs, 
hence, it's not easy to tell the debian upstream watcher (uscan) about it.  Soon, debian will 
have more support for multiple upstream tarballs, and when that happens, these instructions 
will be updated accordingly.  It is not likely that the upstream version number will ever change, 
as these patches are static, and only a change in the timidity configuration syntax would require 
a bump in the version number.

To prepare the source to be built, change to the directory (exported, if working from svn)::

   cd timidity-guspat-installer(-exported)
   ./debian/original-preparation.sh

This should download the upstream tarballs, extract them, create the .orig.tar.gz, and then 
build the source package for you.  If you are having problems running the script, you may 
want to read through the script and perform the steps manually.  The urls to download are 
commented in the debian/watch file.
