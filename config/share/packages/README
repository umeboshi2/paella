Instructions for building the packages in this directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to prepare these packages for building, you will need to 
install the devscripts package.  You will not have to have the 
build dependencies installed on the system that you prepare these
source packages on, but you will need the tools to download and 
prepare the sources to be built.

Instructions for the gkrellm-skins-installer
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you are in a subversion working copy, you should export 
the gkrellm-skins-installer directory::

    svn export gkrellm-skins-installer gkrellm-skins-installer-exported

Then change to that directory::

     cd gkrellm-skins-installer(-exported)

Then prepare the source::

     uscan --force-download --rename --verbose
     dpkg-buildpackage -S

Now you should have the .orig.tar.gz, .diff.gz and .dsc files that are required to build the 
package.  Now you can run pbuilder, cowbuilder, or cowpoke on the .dsc file, or if you want 
to build against the system you are running::

   dpkg-source -x gkrellm-skins-installer_0.0-0.dsc
   cd cd gkrellm-skins-installer-0.0
   debuild
