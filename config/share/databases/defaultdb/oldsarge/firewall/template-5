# Shorewall 1.4 - /etc/shorewall/hosts
#
#	THERE ARE TWO CASES WHERE YOU NEED THIS FILE:
#
#	1) YOU HAVE MULTIPLE NETWORKS IN THE SAME ZONE CONNECTED TO
#	   A SINGLE INTERFACE AND YOU WANT THE SHOREWALL BOX TO ROUTE
#	   BETWEEN THESE NETWORKS.
#
#	2) YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE ZONE CONNECTED THROUGH A SINGLE
#	   INTERFACE.
#
#	IF YOU DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THESE SITUATIONS THEN DON'T TOUCH
#	THIS FILE.
#
#	This file is used to define zones in terms of subnets and/or
#	individual IP addresses. Most simple setups don't need to
#	(should not) place anything in this file.
#
#	ZONE	- The name of a zone defined in /etc/shorewall/zones
#
#	HOST(S)	- The name of an interface followed by a colon (":") and
#		  a comma-separated list whose elements are either:
#
#			a) The IP address of a host
#			b) A subnetwork in the form
#			   <subnet-address>/<mask width>
#
#		  The interface must be defined in the
#		  /etc/shorewall/interfaces file.
#
#		  Examples:
#
#			eth1:192.168.1.3
#			eth2:192.168.2.0/24
#			eth3:192.168.2.0/24,192.168.3.1
#
#	OPTIONS - A comma-separated list of options. Currently-defined
#		  options are:
#
#			maclist	     - Connection requests from these hosts
#				       are compared against the contents of
#				       /etc/shorewall/maclist. If this option
#				       is specified, the interface must be
#				       an ethernet NIC and must be up before
#				       Shorewall is started.
#
#			routeback    - Shorewall show set up the infrastructure
#				       to pass packets from this/these
#				       address(es) back to themselves. This is
#				       necessary of hosts in this group use the
#				       services of a transparent proxy that is
#				       a member of the group or if DNAT is used
#				       to send requests originating from this 
#				       group to a server in the group.
