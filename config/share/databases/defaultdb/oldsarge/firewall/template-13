# Shorewall 1.4 -- RFC1918 File
#
# /etc/shorewall/rfc1918
#
# Lists the subnetworks that are blocked by the 'norfc1918' interface option.
#
# The default list includes those IP addresses listed in RFC 1918, those listed
# as 'reserved' by the IANA, the DHCP Autoconfig class B, and the class C
# reserved for use in documentation and examples.
#
# Columns are:
#
# 	SUBNET		The subnet (host addresses also allowed)
#	TARGET		Where to send packets to/from this subnet
#			RETURN	- let the packet be processed normally
#			DROP	- silently drop the packet
#			logdrop - log then drop
