# These settings are mainly for the wrapper scripts around aide,

# This is the email address reports get mailed to
MAILTO=root

# Set this to suppress mailings when there's nothing to report
#QUIETREPORTS=1

# This parameter defines which aide command to run from the cron script.
# Sensible values are "update" and "check".
# Default is "check", ensuring backwards compatibility.
# Since "update" does not take any longer, it is recommended to use "update",
# so that a new database is created every day. The new database needs to be
# manually copied over the current one, though.
COMMAND=update

# This parameter defines how many lines to return per e-mail. Output longer
# than this value will be truncated in the e-mail sent out.
LINES=1000

# This parameter gives a grep regular expression. If given, all output lines
# that _don't_ match the regexp are listed first in the script's output. This
# allows to easily remove noise from the aide report.
NOISE="(/var/cache/dwww|/var/backups|/var/lib/dwww/html)"
