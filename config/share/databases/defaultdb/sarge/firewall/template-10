# Shorewall 1.4  -- Network Address Translation Table
#
# /etc/shorewall/nat
#
#	This file is used to define one-to-one Network Address Translation
#	(NAT).
#
# WARNING: If all you want to do is simple port forwarding, do NOT use this
#          file. See http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq1. Also, in most
#	   cases, Proxy ARP is a better solution that one-to-one NAT.
#
# Columns must be separated by white space and are:
#
#	EXTERNAL	External IP Address - this should NOT be the primary
#			IP address of the interface named in the next
#			column and must not be a DNS Name.
#	INTERFACE	Interface that we want to EXTERNAL address to appear
#                       on. If ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes in shorewall.conf, you may
#			follow the interface name with ":" and a digit to
#			indicate that you want Shorewall to add the alias
#			with this name (e.g., "eth0:0"). That allows you to
#			see the alias with ifconfig. THAT IS THE ONLY THING
#			THAT THIS NAME IS GOOD FOR -- YOU CANNOT USE IT
#			ANYWHERE ELSE IN YOUR SHORWALL CONFIGURATION.
#	INTERNAL	Internal Address (must not be a DNS Name).
#       ALL INTERFACES  If Yes or yes (or left empty), NAT will be effective
#                       from all hosts. If No or no then NAT will be effective
#                       only through the interface named in the INTERFACE
#                       column
#       LOCAL           If Yes or yes and the ALL INTERFACES column contains
#                       Yes or yes, NAT will be effective from the firewall
#                       system
