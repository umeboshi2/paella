# The Internet monitor defaults to reading tcp connections once per second.
# However, for Linux SMP kernels where reading /proc/net/tcp causes high
# cpu usage, the inet-interval may be set to 1-20 seconds to slow down
# /proc/net/tcp reads.  Or set it to 0 to totally disable the Inet monitor.
# Requires at least gkrellmd version 2.1.8.
#
#inet-interval 1

# Configure gkrellm clients to disconnect from a gkrellmd server if
# there is an io-timeout seconds interval where the client receives no input
# from the server.  Use this for conditions where gkrellmd may be
# ungracefully terminated such that socket connections are not closed.
# Minimum is 2 (less than 2 for no I/O disconnecting and is the default).
# Requires at least 2.1.8 versions of both gkrellmd and gkrellm.
#
#io-timeout 5

# Configure gkrellm clients to attempt automatic reconnects to a
# gkrellmd server every reconnect-timeout seconds after a disconnected
# state is detected.  Disconnected states are created by normal gkrellmd
# shutdowns or by an expiring io-timeout.
# Minimum is 2 (less than 2 for no automatic reconnecting and is the default).
# Requires at least 2.1.8 versions of both gkrellmd and gkrellm.

# Server side local mailbox counts can be sent to gkrellm clients.  List here
# paths to mbox, MH mail, or Maildir style mailboxes.
# Requires at least 2.1.11 versions of both gkrellmd and gkrellm.
