# Shorewall version 1.2 - Rules File
#
# /etc/shorewall/rules 
#
#	Rules in this file govern connection establishment. Requests and
#	responses are automatically allowed using connection tracking.
#
#	In most places where an IP address or subnet is allowed, you
#	can preceed the address/subnet with "!" (e.g., !192.168.1.0/24) to
#	indicate that the rule matches all addresses except the address/subnet
#	given. Notice that no white space is permitted between "!" and the
#	address/subnet.
#
#	If any of the following columns contain the word "none" then the rule
#	is ignored:
#
#		PORT(S), CLIENT PORT(S), CLIENT(S) and SERVER.
#
# Columns are:
#
#
#	RESULT		ACCEPT, DROP or REJECT
#
#				ACCEPT -- allow the connection request
#				DROP   -- ignore the request
#				REJECT -- disallow the request and return an
#					  icmp-unreachable packet.
#
#			May optionally be followed by ":" and a syslog log
#			level (e.g, REJECT:info). This causes the packet to be
#			logged at the specified level.
#
#	CLIENT(S)	Hosts permitted to be clients. May be a zone defined
#			in /etc/shorewall/zones or $FW to indicate the
#			firewall itself.
#
#			Clients may be further restricted to a list of subnets
#			and/or hosts by appending ":" and a comma-separated
#			list of subnets and/or hosts. Hosts may be specified 
#			by IP or MAC address; mac addresses must begin with
#			"~" and must use "-" as a separator.
#
#			dmz:192.168.2.2		Host 192.168.2.2 in the DMZ
#
#			net:155.186.235.0/24	Subnet 155.186.235.0/24 on the
#						Internet
#
#			loc:192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2
#						Hosts 192.168.1.1 and
#						192.168.1.2 in the local zone.
#			loc:~00-A0-C9-15-39-78  Host in the local zone with 
#                                               MAC address 00:A0:C9:15:39:78.
#
#			Alternatively, clients may be specified by interface
#			by appending ":" followed by the interface name. For
#			example, loc:eth1 specifies a client that
#			communicates with the firewall system through eth1.
#
#	SERVER		Location of Server. May be a zone defined in
#			/etc/shorewall/zones or $FW to indicate the firewall
#			itself.
#
#			The server may be further restricted to a particular
#			subnet, host or interface by appending ":" and the
#			subnet, host or interface. See above.
#
#			The port that the server is listening on may be
#			included and separated from the server's IP address by
#			":". If omitted, the firewall will not modifiy the
#			destination port.
#
#			Example: loc:192.168.1.3:8080 specifies a local
#			server at IP address 192.168.1.3 and listening on port
#			8080. The port number MUST be specified as an integer
#			and not as a name from /etc/services.
#
#	PROTO		Protocol - Must be "tcp", "udp", "icmp", a number,
#			"all" or "related". If "related", the remainder of the
#			entry must be omitted and connection requests that are
#			related to existing requests will be accepted.
#
#	PORT(S)		Destination Ports. A comma-separated list of Port
#			names (from /etc/services), port numbers or port
#			ranges; if the protocol is "icmp", this column is
#			interpreted as the destination icmp-type(s).
#
#			This column is ignored if PROTOCOL = all but must be
#			entered if any of the following ields are supplied.
#			In that case, it is suggested that this field contain
#			 "-"
#
#	CLIENT PORT(S)	(Optional) Port(s) used by the client. If omitted,
#			any source port is acceptable. Specified as a comma-
#			separated list of port names, port numbers or port
#			ranges.
#
#			If you don't want to restrict client ports but need to
#			specify an ADDRESS in the next column, then place "-"
#			in this column.
#
#	ADDRESS		(0ptional) If included and different from the IP
#			address given in the SERVER column, this is an address
#			on some interface on the firewall and connections to
#			that address will be forwarded to the IP and port
#			specified in the SERVER column.
#
#			If the special value "all" is used, then requests from
#			the client zone given in the CLIENT(s) column with the
#			destination port given in PORT(s) will be forwarded to
#			the IP address given in SERVER. The value "all" is
#			intended to be used when your internet IP address is
#			dynamic and you want to do port forwarding or you want
#			to do proxy redirection. IT SHOULD NOT BE USED IN ANY
#			OTHER SITUATION.
#
#			The address (or "all") may optionally be followed by
#			a colon (":") an an IP address. This causes Shorewall
#			to use the specified IP address as the source address
#			in forwarded packets. See the Shorewall documentation
#			for restrictions concerning this feature. If no source
#			IP address is given, the original source address is not
#			altered.
#
#	Example: Forward all ssh and http connection requests from the internet
#		 to local system 192.168.1.3
#
#	#RESULT CLIENTS	SERVER(S)	  PROTO	PORT(S)	 CLIENT PORT(S) ADDRESS
#	ACCEPT	net	loc:192.168.1.3 tcp	ssh,http -	        all
#
#	Example: Redirect all locally-originating www connection requests to
#		 port 8080 on the firewall (Squid running on the firewall
#		 system)except when the destination address is 192.168.2.2
#
#	#RESULT CLIENTS	SERVER(S) PROTO	PORTS(S) CLIENT PORT(S)	ADDRESS
#	ACCEPT	loc	$FW::8080  tcp	www	 -		!192.168.2.2
