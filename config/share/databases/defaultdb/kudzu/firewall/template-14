# Shorewall version 1.4 - Rules File
#
# /etc/shorewall/rules
#
#	Rules in this file govern connection establishment. Requests and
#	responses are automatically allowed using connection tracking.
#
#	In most places where an IP address or subnet is allowed, you
#	can preceed the address/subnet with "!" (e.g., !192.168.1.0/24) to
#	indicate that the rule matches all addresses except the address/subnet
#	given. Notice that no white space is permitted between "!" and the
#	address/subnet.
#
# Columns are:
#
#
#	ACTION		ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, DNAT, DNAT-, REDIRECT, CONTINUE,
#			LOG or an <action>.
#
#				ACCEPT   -- allow the connection request
#				DROP     -- ignore the request
#				REJECT   -- disallow the request and return an
#					    icmp-unreachable or an RST packet.
#				DNAT     -- Forward the request to another
#					    system (and optionally another
#					    port).
#				DNAT-    -- Advanced users only.
#					    Like DNAT but only generates the
#					    DNAT iptables rule and not
#					    the companion ACCEPT rule.
#				REDIRECT -- Redirect the request to a local
#					    port on the firewall.
#				REDIRECT-
#					 -- Advanced users only.
#					    Like REDIRET but only generates the
#					    REDIRECT iptables rule and not
#					    the companion ACCEPT rule.
#				CONTINUE -- (For experts only). Do not process
#					    any of the following rules for this
#					    (source zone,destination zone). If
#					    The source and/or destination IP
#					    address falls into a zone defined
#					    later in /etc/shorewall/zones, this
#					    connection request will be passed
#					    to the rules defined for that
#					    (those) zone(s).
#				LOG      -- Simply log the packet and continue.
#				QUEUE	 -- Queue the packet to a user-space
#					    application such as p2pwall.
#				<action> -- The name of an action defined in
#					    /etc/shorewall/actions.
#
#			You may rate-limit the rule by optionally
#			following ACCEPT, DNAT[-], REDIRECT[-] or LOG with
# 
#				< <rate>/<interval>[:<burst>] >
#
#			where <rate> is the number of connections per 
#			<interval> ("sec" or "min") and <burst> is the
#			largest burst permitted. If no <burst> is given,
#			a value of 5 is assumed. There may be no
#			no whitespace embedded in the specification.
#
#				Example: ACCEPT<10/sec:20>
#
#			The ACTION (and rate limit) may optionally be followed
#			by ":" and a syslog log level (e.g, REJECT:info or
#			DNAT<4/sec:8>:debugging). This causes the packet to be
#			logged at the specified level.
#
#			NOTE: For those of you who prefer to place the
#			rate limit in a separate column, see the RATE LIMIT
#			column below. If you specify a value in that column,
#			you must not include a rate limit in the ACTION column
#
#			You may also specify ULOG (must be in upper case) as a
#			log level.This will log to the ULOG target for routing
#			to a separate log through use of ulogd
#			(http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd).
#
#	SOURCE		Source hosts to which the rule applies. May be a zone
#                       defined in /etc/shorewall/zones, $FW to indicate the
#			firewall itself, or "all" If the ACTION is DNAT or
#			REDIRECT, sub-zones of the specified zone may be
#			excluded from the rule by following the zone name with
#			"!' and a comma-separated list of sub-zone names.
#
#			Except when "all" is specified, clients may be further
#			restricted to a list of subnets and/or hosts by
#			appending ":" and a comma-separated list of subnets
#			and/or hosts. Hosts may be specified by IP or MAC
#			address; mac addresses must begin with "~" and must use
#			"-" as a separator.
#
#			dmz:192.168.2.2		Host 192.168.2.2 in the DMZ
#
#			net:155.186.235.0/24	Subnet 155.186.235.0/24 on the
#						Internet
#
#			loc:192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2
#						Hosts 192.168.1.1 and
#						192.168.1.2 in the local zone.
#			loc:~00-A0-C9-15-39-78  Host in the local zone with
#                                               MAC address 00:A0:C9:15:39:78.
#
#			Alternatively, clients may be specified by interface
#			by appending ":" to the zone name followed by the
#			interface name. For example, loc:eth1 specifies a
#			client that communicates with the firewall system
#			through eth1. This may be optionally followed by
#			another colon (":") and an IP/MAC/subnet address
#			as described above (e.g., loc:eth1:192.168.1.5).
#
#	DEST		Location of Server. May be a zone defined in
#			/etc/shorewall/zones, $FW to indicate the firewall
#			itself or "all"
#
#			Except when "all" is specified, the server may be
#			further restricted to a particular subnet, host or
#			interface by appending ":" and the subnet, host or
#			interface. See above.
#
#				Restrictions:
#
#				1. MAC addresses are not allowed.
#				2. In DNAT rules, only IP addresses are
#				   allowed; no FQDNs or subnet addresses
#				   are permitted.
#				3. You may not specify both an interface and
#				   an address.
#
#			Unlike in the SOURCE column, you may specify a range of
#			up to 256 IP addresses using the syntax
#			<first ip>-<last ip>. When the ACTION is DNAT or DNAT-,
#			the connections will be assigned to addresses in the
#			range in a round-robin fashion.
#
#			The port that the server is listening on may be
#			included and separated from the server's IP address by
#			":". If omitted, the firewall will not modifiy the
#			destination port. A destination port may only be
#			included if the ACTION is DNAT or REDIRECT.
#
#			Example: loc:192.168.1.3:3128 specifies a local
#			server at IP address 192.168.1.3 and listening on port
#			3128. The port number MUST be specified as an integer
#			and not as a name from /etc/services.
#
#			if the ACTION is REDIRECT, this column needs only to
#			contain the port number on the firewall that the
#			request should be redirected to.
#
#	PROTO		Protocol - Must be "tcp", "udp", "icmp", a number, or
#			"all".
#
#	DEST PORT(S)    Destination Ports. A comma-separated list of Port
#			names (from /etc/services), port numbers or port
#			ranges; if the protocol is "icmp", this column is
#			interpreted as the destination icmp-type(s).
#
#			A port range is expressed as <low port>:<high port>.
#
#			This column is ignored if PROTOCOL = all but must be
#			entered if any of the following ields are supplied.
#			In that case, it is suggested that this field contain
#			 "-"
#
#			If your kernel contains multi-port match support, then
#			only a single Netfilter rule will be generated if in
#			this list and the CLIENT PORT(S) list below:
#			1. There are 15 or less ports listed.
#			2. No port ranges are included.
#			Otherwise, a separate rule will be generated for each
#			port.
#
#	CLIENT PORT(S)	(Optional) Port(s) used by the client. If omitted,
#			any source port is acceptable. Specified as a comma-
#			separated list of port names, port numbers or port
#			ranges.
#
#			If you don't want to restrict client ports but need to
#			specify an ADDRESS in the next column, then place "-"
#			in this column.
#
#			If your kernel contains multi-port match support, then
#			only a single Netfilter rule will be generated if in
#			this list and the DEST PORT(S) list above:
#			1. There are 15 or less ports listed.
#			2. No port ranges are included.
#			Otherwise, a separate rule will be generated for each
#			port.
#
#	ORIGINAL DEST	(0ptional -- only allowed if ACTION is DNAT[-] or
#                       REDIRECT[-]) If included and different from the IP
#			address given in the SERVER column, this is an address
#			on some interface on the firewall and connections to
#			that address will be forwarded to the IP and port
#			specified in the DEST column.
#
#			A comma-separated list of addresses may also be used. 
#			This is usually most useful with the REDIRECT target 
#			where you want to redirect traffic destined for
#			particular set of hosts.
#
#			Finally, if the list of addresses begins with "!" then
#			the rule will be followed only if the original 
#			destination address in the connection request does not
#			match any of the addresses listed.
#
#			The address (list) may optionally be followed by
#			a colon (":") and a second IP address. This causes
#			Shorewall to use the second IP address as the source
#			address in forwarded packets. See the Shorewall
#			documentation for restrictions concerning this feature.
#			If no source IP address is given, the original source
#			address is not altered.
#
#	RATE LIMIT	You may rate-limit the rule by placing a value in 
#			this colume:
# 
#				<rate>/<interval>[:<burst>]
#
#			where <rate> is the number of connections per 
#			<interval> ("sec" or "min") and <burst> is the
#			largest burst permitted. If no <burst> is given,
#			a value of 5 is assumed. There may be no
#			no whitespace embedded in the specification.
#
#				Example: 10/sec:20
#
#			If you place a rate limit in this column, you may not
#			place a similar limit in the ACTION column.
#
#	USER SET	This column may only be non-empty if the SOURCE is
#			the firewall itself and the ACTION is ACCEPT, DROP or
#			REJECT.
#			
#			The column may contain a user set name defined in the
#			/etc/shorewall/usersets file or it may contain:
#
#			   [<user name or number>]:[<group name or number>]
#
#			When this column is non-empty, the rule applies only
#			if the program generating the output is running under
#			the effective <user>(s) and/or <group>(s) specified.
#			When a user set name is given, a log level may not be
#			present in the ACTION column; logging for such rules is
#			controlled by the user set's entry in 
#			/etc/shorewall/usersets.
