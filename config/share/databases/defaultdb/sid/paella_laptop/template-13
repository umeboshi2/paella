# General note about log levels. Log levels are a method of describing
# to syslog (8) the importance of a message and a number of parameters
# in this file have log levels as their value.
#
# Valid levels are:
#
#	7	debug
#	6	info
#	5	notice
#	4	warning
#	3	err
#	2	crit
#	1	alert
#	0	emerg
#
# For most Shorewall logging, a level of 6 (info) is appropriate. Shorewall
# log messages are generated by NetFilter and are logged using facility
# 'kern' and the level that you specifify. If you are unsure of the level
# to choose, 6 (info) is a safe bet. You may specify levels by name or by
# number.
#
# If you have build your kernel with ULOG target support, you may also
# specify a log level of ULOG (must be all caps). Rather than log its
# messages to syslogd, Shorewall will direct netfilter to log the messages
# via the ULOG target which will send them to a process called 'ulogd'.
# ulogd is available from http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd and can be
# configured to log all Shorewall message to their own log file

#
# LOG FILE LOCATION
#
# This variable tells the /sbin/shorewall program where to look for Shorewall
# log messages. If not set or set to an empty string (e.g., LOGFILE="") then
# /var/log/messages is assumed.
#
# WARNING: The LOGFILE variable simply tells the 'shorewall' program where to
#          look for Shorewall messages.It does NOT control the destination for
#          these messages. For information about how to do that, see
#
#              http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_logging.html

LOGFILE=/var/log/messages

#
# LOG FORMAT
#
# Shell 'printf' Formatting template for the --log-prefix value in log messages
# generated by Shorewall to identify Shorewall log messages. The supplied
# template is expected to accept either two or three arguments; the first is
# the chain name, the second (optional) is the logging rule number within that
# chain and the third is the ACTION specifying the disposition of the packet
# being logged. You must use the %d formatting type for the rule number; if your
# template does not contain %d then the rule number will not be included.
#
# If you want to integrate Shorewall with fireparse, then set LOGFORMAT as:
#
#	LOGFORMAT="fp=%s:%d a=%s "
#
# If not specified or specified as empty (LOGFORMAT="") then the value
# "Shorewall:%s:%s:" is assumed.
# 
# CAUTION: /sbin/shorewall uses the leading part of the LOGFORMAT string (up 
# to but not including the first '%') to find log messages in the 'show log',
# 'status' and 'hits' commands. This part should not be omitted (the 
# LOGFORMAT should not begin with "%") and the leading part should be
# sufficiently unique for /sbin/shorewall to identify Shorewall messages.

LOGFORMAT="Shorewall:%s:%s:"

#
# LOG RATE LIMITING
#
# The next two variables can be used to control the amount of log output
# generated. LOGRATE is expressed as a number followed by an optional
# `/second',  `/minute', `/hour', or `/day' suffix and specifies the maximum
# rate at which a particular message will occur. LOGBURST determines the
# maximum initial burst size that will be logged. If set empty, the default
# value of 5 will be used.
#
# Example:
#
#	LOGRATE=10/minute
#	LOGBURST=5
#
# If BOTH variables are set empty then logging will not be rate-limited.
#

LOGRATE=
LOGBURST=

#
# LEVEL AT WHICH TO LOG 'UNCLEAN' PACKETS
#
# This variable determines the level at which Mangled/Invalid packets are logged
# under the 'dropunclean' interface option. If you set this variable to an
# empty value (e.g., LOGUNCLEAN= ), Mangled/Invalid packets will be dropped
# silently.
#
# The value of this variable also determines the level at which Mangled/Invalid
# packets are logged under the 'logunclean' interface option. If the variable
# is empty, these packets will still be logged at the 'info' level.
#
# See the comment at the top of this section for a description of log levels
#

LOGUNCLEAN=info

#
# BLACKLIST LOG LEVEL
#
# Set this variable to the syslogd level that you want blacklist packets logged
# (beware of DOS attacks resulting from such logging). If not set, no logging
# of blacklist packets occurs.
#
# See the comment at the top of this section for a description of log levels
#
BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL=

#
# LOGGING 'New not SYN' rejects
#
# This variable only has an effect when NEWNOTSYN=No (see below).
#
# When a TCP packet that does not have the SYN flag set and the ACK and RST
# flags clear then unless the packet is part of an established connection,
# it will be rejected by the firewall. If you want these rejects logged,
# then set LOGNEWNOTSYN to the syslog log level at which you want them logged.
#
# See the comment at the top of this section for a description of log levels
#
# Example: LOGNEWNOTSYN=debug


LOGNEWNOTSYN=info

#
# MAC List Log Level
#
# Specifies the logging level for connection requests that fail MAC
# verification. If set to the empty value (MACLIST_LOG_LEVEL="") then
# such connection requests will not be logged.
#
# See the comment at the top of this section for a description of log levels
#

MACLIST_LOG_LEVEL=info

#
# TCP FLAGS Log Level
#
# Specifies the logging level for packets that fail TCP Flags
# verification. If set to the empty value (TCP_FLAGS_LOG_LEVEL="") then
# such packets will not be logged.
#
# See the comment at the top of this section for a description of log levels
#

TCP_FLAGS_LOG_LEVEL=info

#
# RFC1918 Log Level
#
# Specifies the logging level for packets that fail RFC 1918
# verification. If set to the empty value (RFC1918_LOG_LEVEL="") then
# RFC1918_LOG_LEVEL=info is assumed.
#
# See the comment at the top of this section for a description of log levels

# NAME OF THE FIREWALL ZONE
#
# Name of the firewall zone -- if not set or if set to an empty string, "fw"
# is assumed.
#
FW=fw

#
# ENABLE IP FORWARDING
#
# If you say "On" or "on" here, IPV4 Packet Forwarding is enabled. If you
# say "Off" or "off", packet forwarding will be disabled. You would only want
# to disable packet forwarding if you are installing Shorewall on a
# standalone system or if you want all traffic through the Shorewall system
# to be handled by proxies.
#
# If you set this variable to "Keep" or "keep", Shorewall will neither
# enable nor disable packet forwarding.
#
IP_FORWARDING=Keep

#
# AUTOMATICALLY ADD NAT IP ADDRESSES
#
# If you say "Yes" or "yes" here, Shorewall will automatically add IP addresses
# for each NAT external address that you give in /etc/shorewall/nat. If you say
# "No" or "no", you must add these aliases youself.
#
ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes

#
# AUTOMATICALLY ADD SNAT IP ADDRESSES
#
# If you say "Yes" or "yes" here, Shorewall will automatically add IP addresses
# for each SNAT external address that you give in /etc/shorewall/masq. If you say
# "No" or "no", you must add these aliases youself. LEAVE THIS SET TO "No" unless
# you are sure that you need it -- most people don't!!!
#
ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=No

#
# ENABLE TRAFFIC SHAPING
#
# If you say "Yes" or "yes" here, Traffic Shaping is enabled in the firewall. If
# you say "No" or "no" then traffic shaping is not enabled. If you enable traffic
# shaping you must have iproute[2] installed (the "ip" and "tc" utilities) and
# you must enable packet mangling above.
#
TC_ENABLED=No

#
# Clear Traffic Shapping/Control
#
# If this option is set to 'No' then Shorewall won't clear the current
# traffic control rules during [re]start. This setting is intended
# for use by people that prefer to configure traffic shaping when
# the network interfaces come up rather than when the firewall
# is started. If that is what you want to do, set TC_ENABLED=Yes and
# CLEAR_TC=No and do not supply an /etc/shorewall/tcstart file. That
# way, your traffic shaping rules can still use the 'fwmark'
# classifier based on packet marking defined in /etc/shorewall/tcrules.
#
# If omitted, CLEAR_TC=Yes is assumed.

CLEAR_TC=Yes

#
# Mark Packets in the forward chain
#
# When processing the tcrules file, Shorewall normally marks packets in the
# PREROUTING chain. To cause Shorewall to use the FORWARD chain instead, set
# this to "Yes". If not specified or if set to the empty value (e.g.,
# MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN="") then MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=No is assumed.
#
# Marking packets in the FORWARD chain has the advantage that inbound
# packets destined for Masqueraded/SNATed local hosts have had their destination
# address rewritten so they can be marked based on their destination. When
# packets are marked in the PREROUTING chain, packets destined for
# Masqueraded/SNATed local hosts still have a destination address corresponding
# to the firewall's external interface.
#
# Note: Older kernels do not support marking packets in the FORWARD chain and
#       setting this variable to Yes may cause startup problems.

MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=No

#
# MSS CLAMPING
#
# Set this variable to "Yes" or "yes" if you want the TCP "Clamp MSS to PMTU"
# option. This option is most commonly required when your internet
# interface is some variant of PPP (PPTP or PPPoE). Your kernel must
# have CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS set.
#
# [From the kernel help:
#
#    This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
#    MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
#    connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
#    minus 40).
#
#    This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
#    block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
#    problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
#    firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
#    packets:
#        1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
#	 2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
#	 3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.
# ]
#
# If left blank, or set to "No" or "no", the option is not enabled.
#
CLAMPMSS=No

#
# ROUTE FILTERING
#
# Set this variable to "Yes" or "yes" if you want kernel route filtering on all
# interfaces (anti-spoofing measure).
#
# If this variable is not set or is set to the empty value, "No" is assumed.
# In that case, you can still enable route filtering on individual interfaces
# in the /etc/shorewall/interfaces file.

ROUTE_FILTER=Yes

#
# NAT BEFORE RULES
#
# Shorewall has traditionally processed static NAT rules before port forwarding
# rules. If you would like to reverse the order, set this variable to "No".
#
# If this variable is not set or is set to the empty value, "Yes" is assumed.

NAT_BEFORE_RULES=Yes

# DNAT IP ADDRESS DETECTION
#
# Normally when Shorewall encounters the following rule:
#
#	DNAT	net	loc:192.168.1.3	tcp	80
#
# it will forward TCP port 80 connections from the net to 192.168.1.3
# REGARDLESS OF THE ORIGINAL DESTINATION ADDRESS. This behavior is
# convenient for two reasons:
#
#	a) If the the network interface has a dynamic IP address, the
#	   firewall configuration will work even when the address
#	   changes.
#
#	b) It saves having to configure the IP address in the rule
#	   while still allowing the firewall to be started before the
#	   internet interface is brought up.
#
# This default behavior can also have a negative effect. If the
# internet interface has more than one IP address then the above
# rule will forward connection requests on all of these addresses;
# that may not be what is desired.
#
# By setting DETECT_DNAT_IPADDRS=Yes, rules such as the above will apply
# only if the original destination address is the primary IP address of
# one of the interfaces associated with the source zone. Note that this
# requires all interfaces to the source zone to be up when the firewall
# is [re]started.

DETECT_DNAT_IPADDRS=No

#
# MUTEX TIMEOUT
#
# The value of this variable determines the number of seconds that programs
# will wait for exclusive access to the Shorewall lock file. After the number
# of seconds corresponding to the value of this variable, programs will assume
# that the last program to hold the lock died without releasing the lock.
#
# If not set or set to the empty value, a value of 60 (60 seconds) is assumed.
#
# An appropriate value for this parameter would be twice the length of time
# that it takes your firewall system to process a "shorewall restart" command.

MUTEX_TIMEOUT=60

#
# NEWNOTSYN
#
# If this variable is set to "No" or "no", then when a TCP packet that does
# not have the SYN flag set and the ACK and RST flags clear then unless the
# packet is part of an established connection, it will be dropped by the
# firewall
#
# If this variable is set to "Yes" or "yes" then such packets will not be
# dropped but will pass through the normal rule processing.
#
# Users with a High-availability setup with two firewall's and one acting
# as a backup should set NEWNOTSYN=Yes. Users with asymmetric routing may
# also need to select NEWNOTSYN=Yes.
#
# The behavior of NEWNOTSYN=Yes may also be enabled on a per-interface basis 
# using the 'newnotsyn' option in /etc/shorewall/interfaces.

NEWNOTSYN=No

#
# FOR ADMINS THAT REPEATEDLY SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT
#
# Normally, when a "shorewall stop" command is issued or an error occurs during
# the execution of another shorewall command, Shorewall puts the firewall into
# a state where only traffic to/from the hosts listed in
# /etc/shorewall/routestopped is accepted. 
#
# When performing remote administration on a Shorewall firewall, it is
# therefore recommended that the IP address of the computer being used for
# administration be added to the firewall's /etc/shorewall/routestopped file.
#
# Some administrators have a hard time remembering to do this with the result
# that they get to drive across town in the middle of the night to restart
# a remote firewall (or worse, they have to get someone out of bed to drive 
# across town to restart a very remote firewall).
#
# For those administrators, we offer ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes. With this setting,
# when the firewall enters the 'stopped' state:
#
# All traffic that is part of or related to established connections is still
# allowed and all OUTPUT traffic is allowed. This is in addition to traffic
# to and from hosts listed in /etc/shorewall/routestopped.
#
# If this variable is not set or it is set to the null value then
# ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No is assumed.
#
ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes
