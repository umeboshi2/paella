This trait is reponsible for getting machines to boot from the network.  There is really nothing done in this trait anymore, but this is mainly because I haven't defined a good policy on what to do anymore.  It seems that tftpd adds itself to inetd these days, and live-helper will make files that can be put in the tftpboot directory.  On top of this, I'd like to be able to use pxe for installing windows hosts, and this means that both the old paella method, and the debian live methods for filling the tftpboot directory are both insufficient.
