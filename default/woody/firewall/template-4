# Shorewall 1.2 -- Policy File
#
# /etc/shorewall/policy
#
#	This file determines what to do with a new connection request if we
#	don't get a match from the /etc/shorewall/rules file or from the
#	/etc/shorewall/common[.def] file. For each client/server pair, the
#	file is processed in order until a match is found ("all" will match
#	any client or server).
#
# Columns are:
#
#	CLIENT		Location of client. Must be the name of a zone defined
#			in /etc/shorewall/zones, $FW or "all".
#
#	SERVER		Location of server. Must be the name of a zone defined
#			in /etc/shorewall/zones, $FW or "all"
#
#	POLICY		Policy if no match from the rules file is found. Must
#			be "ACCEPT", "DENY", "REJECT" or "CONTINUE"
#
#	LOG LEVEL	If supplied, each connection handled under the default
#			POLICY is logged at that level. If not supplied, no
#			log message is generated. See syslog.conf(5) for a
#			description of log levels.
#
#			If you don't want to log but need to specify the
#			following column, place "_" here.
#
#	As shipped, the default policies are:
#
#	a) All connections from the local network to the internet are allowed
#	b) All connections from the network are ignored but logged at syslog
#	   level KERNEL.INFO.
#	d) All other connection requests are rejected and logged at level
#	   KERNEL.INFO.
