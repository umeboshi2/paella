# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.

#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not many any basic syntactic 
# errors.

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

# Change this for the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = <--|samba_workgroup|-->

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = %h server (Samba %v)

# If you want to automatically load your printer list rather
# than setting them up individually then you'll need this
;   load printers = yes

# You may wish to override the location of the printcap file
;   printcap name = /etc/printcap

# 'printing = cups' works nicely
;   printing = bsd

;   guest account = nobody
   invalid users = root

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
   max log size = 1000

# If you want Samba to log though syslog only then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'. Please note that logging through syslog in
# Samba is still experimental.
;   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smb,nmb} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server. See
# security_level.txt for details.
   security = <--|samba_security|-->

# You may wish to use password encryption. Please read ENCRYPTION.txt,
# Win95.txt and WinNT.txt in the Samba documentation. Do not enable this
# option unless you have read those documents
   encrypt passwords = true

# Using the following line enables you to customise your configuration
# on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
# of the machine that is connecting
;   include = /home/samba/etc/smb.conf.%m

# Most people will find that this option gives better performance.
# See speed.txt and the manual pages for details
# You may want to add the following on a Linux system:
#         SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
   socket options = TCP_NODELAY

# --- Browser Control Options ---

# Please _read_ BROWSING.txt and set the next four parameters according
# to your network setup. The defaults are specified below (commented
# out.) It's important that you read BROWSING.txt so you don't break
# browsing in your network!

# set local master to no if you don't want Samba to become a master
# browser on your network. Otherwise the normal election rules apply
   local master = <--|samba_local_master|-->

# OS Level determines the precedence of this server in master browser
# elections. The default value should be reasonable
   os level = <--|samba_oslevel|-->

# Domain Master specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser. This
# allows Samba to collate browse lists between subnets. Don't use this
# if you already have a Windows NT domain controller doing this job
   domain master = <--|samba_domain_master|-->

# Preferred Master causes Samba to force a local browser election on startup
# and gives it a slightly higher chance of winning the election
   preferred master = <--|samba_preferred_master|-->

# --- End of Browser Control Options ---

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable it's WINS Server

# This boolean parameter controlls whether Samba attempts to sync. the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# /etc/samba/smbpasswd file is changed.
;   unix password sync = false

# For Unix password sync. to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Augustin Luton <aluton@hybrigenics.fr> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Potato).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n .

# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
;   pam password change = no

# The following parameter is useful only if you have the linpopup package
# installed. The samba maintainer and the linpopup maintainer are
# working to ease installation and configuration of linpopup and samba.
;   message command = /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/linpopup "%f" "%m" %s; rm %s' &
