# This file stores the addresses of config sources for GConf
# When a value is stored or requested, the sources are scanned from top to 
# bottom, and the first one to have a value for the key (or the first one 
# to be writeable) is used to load/store the data.

# See the GConf manual for details

# Look first in systemwide mandatory settings directory
# (commented out until xml backend knows how to be read-only for users)
xml:readonly:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory

# Now see where users want us to look - basically the user can stick arbitrary 
# sources in a ~/.gconf.path file and they're inserted here
include "$(HOME)/.gconf.path"

# Give users a default storage location, ~/.gconf

xml:readwrite:$(HOME)/.gconf

# Finally, look at the systemwide defaults
# (commented out for now)
xml:readonly:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults
