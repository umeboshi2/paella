# This is an example quotatab file
# 
# This file is used as a translation for device names, so a warnquota message
# makes sense to the user.
#
# syntax is as follows:
#
# colon ':' is used to specify the start of the substituted text
# pipe  '|' is used to specify a line break
#
# device:substituted text
# device:text on line 1|test on line2
#
# For instance if you would like to have warnquota tell the user their
# 'mailspool' is full instead of '/dev/hdb1' is full, use the following
# example.
#
# /dev/hdb1:mailspool
