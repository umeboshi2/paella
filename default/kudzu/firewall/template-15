# Shorewall version 1.4 - Traffic Control Rules File
#
# /etc/shorewall/tcrules
#
#	Entries in this file cause packets to be marked as a means of
#	classifying them for traffic control or policy routing.
#
#                              I M P O R T A N T ! ! ! !
#
#		FOR ENTRIES IN THIS FILE TO HAVE ANY EFFECT, YOU MUST SET
#		TC_ENABLED=Yes in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf
#
# Columns are:
#
#
#	MARK		The mark value which is an
#			integer in the range 1-255
#
#			May optionally be followed by ":P" or ":F"
#			where ":P" indicates that marking should occur in
#			the PREROUTING chain and ":F" indicates that marking
#			should occur in the FORWARD chain. If neither
#			":P" nor ":F" follow the mark value then the chain is
#			determined by the setting of MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN in
#			/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.
#
#	SOURCE 		Source of the packet. A comma-separated list of
#			interface names, IP addresses, MAC addresses
#			and/or subnets. Use $FW if the packet originates on
#			the firewall in which case the MARK column may NOT
#			specify either ":P" or ":F" (marking always occurs
#			in the OUTPUT chain).
#
#			MAC addresses must be prefixed with "~" and use
#			"-" as a separator.
#
#			Example: ~00-A0-C9-15-39-78
#
#	DEST		Destination of the packet. Comma separated list of
#			IP addresses and/or subnets.
#
#	PROTO		Protocol - Must be "tcp", "udp", "icmp", a number,
#			or "all".
#
#	PORT(S)		Destination Ports. A comma-separated list of Port
#			names (from /etc/services), port numbers or port
#			ranges; if the protocol is "icmp", this column is
#			interpreted as the destination icmp-type(s).
#
#			This column is ignored if PROTOCOL = all but must be
#			entered if any of the following field is supplied.
#			In that case, it is suggested that this field contain
#			 "-"
#
#	CLIENT PORT(S)	(Optional) Port(s) used by the client. If omitted,
#			any source port is acceptable. Specified as a comma-
#			separated list of port names, port numbers or port
#			ranges.
#
#	USER		This column may only be non-empty if the SOURCE is
#			the firewall itself.
#
#			When this column is non-empty, the rule applies only
#			if the program generating the output is running under
#			the effective user and/or group.
#
#			It may contain :
#
#			   [<user name or number>]:[<group name or number>]
#
#			The colon is optionnal when specifying only a user.
#			Examples : john: / john / :users / john:users
