### This file configures various client-side behaviors.
###
### The commented-out examples below are intended to demonstrate
### how to use this file.

### Section for authentication and authorization customizations.
### Set store-password to 'no' to avoid storing your subversion
### passwords in the auth/ area of your config directory.
### It defaults to 'yes'.  Note that this option only prevents
### saving of *new* credentials;  it doesn't invalidate existing
### caches.  (To do that, remove the cache files by hand.)
# [auth]
# store-password = no

### Section for configuring external helper applications.
### Set editor to the command used to invoke your text editor.
###   This will override the environment variables that Subversion
###   examines by default to find this information ($EDITOR, 
###   et al).
### Set diff-cmd to the absolute path of your `diff' program.
###   This will override the compile-time default, which is to use
###   Subversion's internal diff implementation.
### Set diff3-cmd to the absolute path of your `diff3' program.
###   This will override the compile-time default, which is to use
###   Subversion's internal diff3 implementation.
### Set diff3-has-program-arg to `true' or `yes' if your `diff3'
###   program accepts the `--diff-program' option.
# [helpers]
# editor-cmd = editor (vi, emacs, notepad, etc.)
# diff-cmd = diff_program (diff, gdiff, etc.)
# diff3-cmd = diff3_program (diff3, gdiff3, etc.)
# diff3-has-program-arg = [true | false]

### Section for configuring tunnel agents.
# [tunnels]
### Configure svn protocol tunnel schemes here.  By default, only
### the `ssh' scheme is defined.  You can define other schemes to
### be used with `svn+scheme://hostname/path' URLs.  A scheme
### definition is simply a command, optionally prefixed by an
### environment variable name which can override the command if it
### is defined.  The command (or environment variable) may contain
### arguments, using standard shell quoting for arguments with
### spaces.  The command will be invoked as:
###   <command> <hostname> svnserve -t
### If the built-in ssh scheme were not predefined, it could be
### defined as:
# ssh = $SVN_SSH ssh
### If you wanted to define a new `rsh' scheme, to be used with
### 'svn+rsh:' URLs, you could do so as follows:
# rsh = rsh
### Or, if you wanted to specify a full path and arguments:
# rsh = /path/to/rsh -l myusername
### On Windows, if you are specifying a full path to a command,
### use a forward slash (/) or a paired backslash (\\) as the
### path separator.  A single backslash will be treated as an
### escape for the following character.

### Section for configuring miscelleneous Subversion options.
# [miscellany]
### Set global-ignores to a set of whitespace-delimited globs
###   which Subversion will ignore in its `status' output.
# global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store
### Set log-encoding to the default encoding for log messages
# log-encoding = latin1

### See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=668
### for what else will soon be customized in this file.
