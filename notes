Objects and Definitions
--------------------------------

Trait 
------
A trait is the atomic unit that signifies a feature. 
A trait can have packages, parents, templates, scripts and a set of variables.

- parents

  + no trait can be processed during the installation before all
    of its parents are processed.	     
  + parents are not required, but most traits should depend on a default
    trait.

  + no trait can be processed during the installation before all of its
    parents are processed. 

- packages

  + this is a list of packages to install or remove 
    - although other options are available, only install and remove are supported now 
  + packages are not required 
 
- templates 

  + templates can have simple tags for variable substitution 
  + templates store user/group and chmod permissions 
  + a template must currently be attached to a package 
    
    - this feature should be removed, because traits that only need 
      traits get vestigial packages assigned to them like base-files, 
      initscripts, or bash 
  + currently the var/cache/debconf/config.dat template is reserved 
    for debconf 

- environment 

  + a collection of name, value pairs for use in the templates and scripts 
  + a trait's environment contains its parents' environment 
  + a big python dictionary is made of the environment where the keys
      are formed as "trait_name" where trait is the trait and name is the 
      name of the variable.

- scripts 

  + a trait is not required to have a script 
  + only three types of scripts are currently supported, pre, post, and chroot 

    - chroot is a special script that is run in a chrooted environment in the target area. 
      This script should be aware of what's on the target system and only depend on 
      those things. The script shouldn't connect to paella or depend on other installation 
      tools not present in the target system. 
    - pre is executed before anything else is processed in the trait. 
      The pre script is executed with an os.system. 
    - post is the very last action to perform in the trait 
      + post should be able to talk to database and environment 
 
Family
--------

- A family is a collection of variables from different traits 

  + a family can have parents 
  + a family is not tied to a suite 

Profile
-------

- A profile is a collection of traits, and an environment

  + Traits - the traits listed in the profile are ordered 
  + Families - an unordered list of families 
  + Environment
	- the profile environment overrides the trait environments 
	  and the family environment 

Machine Type
-------------

A machine type currently only describes the disks on the machine, and a list
of kernel modules.
current policy is to treat all devices of a certain diskname as a raid1 array 
Kernel: 
a kernel is simply the name of a kernel image package 
the package must be installable by apt, in a chroot environment, on the target system. 
Mount: 
a mount is named 
a mount describes filesystem type, mount option, dump, pass and the mount point 
Filesystem: 
a filesystem is an ordered map of mounts to partition numbers 
this is done on filesystem_mounts 
the target fstab will be completely formed from the filesystem information 
Machine: 
a machine contains 
a name 
a machine type 
a kernel 
a filesystem 
a profile
