This project is inspired heavily by FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) by Thomas Lange.

FAI's homepage -- http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/

This README is really, really old.  I need to update this once I finish
getting paella put back together again.

unlike FAI (probably not true anymore), paella is able to install different suites 
simultaneously.  It uses a postgres database to store most of the configuration,
including text file templates.

Outdated, use reprepro now.
there are a couple little modules to help mirror/sync a debian mirror.
it is planned to be able to create/sync a partial binary repository,
and create/sync a partial source repository complete with its
build-deps.

UPDATE:
the paella-debrepos has the tools to create and maintain a small mini-dinstall
server, and a custom mirror (no partial mirrors, yet).
(no more paella-debrepos package, using reprepro)
(I may write a frontend to reprepro in the near future)


the nfsroot installer is planned to be sid based, while the nfs/postgres server
will run sarge
(not true anymore, the installer can now run from stable)


python 2.3 is required now (This is really old)

the project is still alive. :) (This hasn't changed)

btw, this system isn't really designed for beowulf clusters, but for creating and
managing very complex network/system configurations, and migrating installations
by just keeping track of packages/configs/data rather than system images and
complete backups


there is information about the structure of the database in the document section
of the berlios site.


the profile was chosen to be the singlemost install unit.  This means
that paella can only install profiles.  A profile is a collection of
traits and an enviroment. Profile overrides traits.  So a variable in
the profile enviroment overrides all of the corresponding trait
enviroments in that profile.  So, the trait enviroments can be seen as
default values and the profiles are more specific.  Currently, there is
little support for profile environments (but, it's part of the design).
(This part needs updating too)
