{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n## Windows\n\nPaella has the ability to install Microsoft Windows 7 over the network.  Evaluation\n[iso images](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/cannot-find-digital-river-download-site/66a8439b-0d16-4b70-92f7-1c8486a46ebf) can be obtained to help with development.  In the development environment,\nan evaluation iso for both i386 and amd64 are mounted loopback on the server and\nserved through samba.  A special iso is created on the server using\n[wimlib](http://wimlib.sourceforge.net/) that contains a script to\nmount the samba share and start an unattended install.\n\nAutomated installations of windows have been inspired by\n[unattended](http://unattended.sourceforge.net/).  The ability to\ninstall and configure a windows system in a manner similar to FAI or paella\nis appealing, however the length of time and excessive rebooting required\nby windows makes it infeasible to automate installs in this manner.  Instead,\na middle road will be taken by working to automate the creation of\nreference images that can be automatically installed with paella.\n\nThe installation of a reference image over the network is rather interesting.  The\ndebian-live system partitions the disk and creates an NTFS filesystem, then uses\nwimlib-imagex to install the image to the filesystem.  After this, a\n[virtualbox](https://virtualbox.org) VM is created and the physical\nhard drive on the machine is attached to it.  The VM then boots from an iso\nthat runs a script to configure the boot manager.  The windows machine is\ncompletely installed and ready to boot without having to leave the\ndebian-live system!  The simple script that does this can be viewed\n[here](https://github.com/umeboshi2/paella/blob/master/vagrant/salt/roots/salt/debianlive/install-win7-image.sh).\n\n\n", "id": "mswindows"}
