# [Paella](#)

## Introduction 

Paella is a system for that has been used to install preconfigured 
debian systems over a local network in a manner similar to FAI_.  The 
project started in 2004 as a set of scripts within the FAI installer than 
communicated with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve the configuration for 
the target machine.

The old website for this project is at http://paella.berlios.de

## Outline

How is paella going to work?

Two deployment scenarios:

1. Set up a network in the office or workplace of a person who creates servers 
   for people.  This person can use paella to create fully configured machines 
   that can be physically carried and installed at another location.

2. Set up a network where the hosts on the network are installed and managed 
   by a paella server.
