{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n### PXE Issues\n\nNetbooting varies from machine to machine.  There are many machines that will \nnot boot from the network unless a key, like F12, is pressed during the \npreboot.  \n\nOther machines will readily boot from the network at first option.  I intend \nfor paella to be flexible enough to handle these situations.  The default \npxe config file will default to booting from the first hard drive \nautomatically after a ten second delay.  A machine that boots from the \nnetwork by default, or as the first boot device, will effectively \ndefault to booting from their first hard drive.\n\n\n", "id": "pxe-issues"}
