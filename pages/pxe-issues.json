{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n### PXE Issues\n\nNetbooting varies from machine to machine.  There are many machines that will \nnot boot from the network unless a key, like F12, is pressed during the \npreboot.  Other machines will readily boot from the network as the first \nboot option.  The default pxe configuration file will default to booting \nfrom the first hard drive automatically after a ten second delay.  \n\nWhen a machine is set to be installed, the machine's specific pxe \nconfiguration file will default to booting the installer, and by \ndefault wait for a console user to press enter on the keyboard.\n\nThere is an autoinstall option that will configure the machine's specific \npxe file to boot without needing a console user to press a key, probably \nwith a five to ten second delay.\n\n", "id": "pxe-issues"}
