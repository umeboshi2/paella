{"content": "# PXE Issues\n\nNetbooting varies from machine to machine.  There are many machines that will \nnot boot from the network unless a key, like F12, is pressed during the \npreboot.  Other machines will readily boot from the network as the first \nboot option.  The default pxe configuration file will default to booting \nfrom the first hard drive automatically after a ten second delay.  \n\nWhen a machine is set to be installed, the machine's specific pxe \nconfiguration file will default to booting the installer, and by \ndefault wait for a console user to press enter on the keyboard.\n\nThere is an autoinstall option that will configure the machine's specific \npxe file to boot without needing a console user to press a key, probably \nwith a five to ten second delay.\n\n# iPXE\n\nI need to mention [iPXE](https://ipxe.org).  iPXE is a replacement\npxe image for common pxe clients.  The iPXE code provides for retrieving the\nbootloader over the network using modern protocols, as well as the standard\ntftp protocol.\n\n# UEFI\n\nAfter looking at the debian installer for a while, it seems that in order to\nboot UEFI enabled clients, a small swarm of efi modules may be necessesarily\nplaced somwhere in the tftpboot directory.\n\nAfter looking at a couple of laptops, the bigger problem seems to be how\nto enable netboot on these machines.  It seems that a network efi module\nmust be installed manually on these systems before the system can boot\nfrom the network.\n\n# hello thewre\n", "id": "pxe-issues"}
