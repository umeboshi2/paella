{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n### System UUID\n\nThe machines on the paella network are identified by their system \nuuid.  In normal network operations, AFAICT, the system uuid is only \ntransferred over the network during the PXE negotiation, in plaintext.  \nWhen using paella, the uuid, is transferred over the network in http \nrequests by the client when identifying itself to the server.  The paella \ndatabase should not provide a uuid to a paella client.\n\nEven though paella is really meant to be used on a local network where \nthe administrator has enough physical access and monitoring ability to \nprovide trust during a network install, it would be valuable to raise \nthe bar of an attacker to the point of having to discover or guess a \nsystem uuid.  Due to the nature of PXE, attempts to write code that \nwould block an attacker that sniffs the network would be pointless.  \nThe design is mostly to keep a user of one machine to be able to \nretrieve the pillar data or minion keys of another machine.\n\n", "id": "system-uuid"}
