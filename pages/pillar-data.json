{"content": "# Pillar Data\n\nThe default pillar data is in a git repository.  I desire for these pillar \nfiles, eventually, to be python scripts that access a database using \nSQLAlchemy.\n\nThere are currently other problems with having the data in a pillar.  The \nability to refer to pillar keys within the pillar is not directly \navailable.  Due to the fact that pillar data is basically a set of nested \ndictionaries, it should be possible to achieve the desired results through \na different pillar rendering system.\n\n", "id": "pillar-data"}
