{"content": "# NEWS\n\n- Paella has been rewritten completely.  \n\n- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is being used to create a \n  development environment.\n\n- Currently using chef/debian-7.4 vagrant box (amd64)\n\n- Using Debian Installer via PXE for first stage install\n\n- Using [salt](http://saltstack.org/) for second stage\n  installation and configuration.\n\n- Using system [uuid's](#pages/system-uuid) to for machine \n  identification and network access.  MACs from ethernet interfaces\n  are no longer required to identify machines. (Code to consistently\n  generate a uuid based on network interfaces on machines lacking\n  a SMBIOS to retrieve the system uuid from should be looked into\n  using.  It is expected that most i386/amd64 machines will have\n  a system uuid, however armhf (raspberrrypi) machines won't have\n  this.\n\n- Currently supporting i386 and amd64 debian installs.\n\n- A preliminary environment exists to help manage windows \n  installations.  The installation of a customized system \n  can be performed automatically, but the system can, and \n  for the time being will have to be, configured manually \n  using sysprep.\n\n- Web interface to help manage machines and configurations.  The web\n  server uses [trumpet](https://github.com/umeboshi2/trumpet.git),\n  which is a small collection of code to help make pyramid web services that\n  support RESTful interaction.  The client side browser application uses the\n  \"paella\" branch of [conspectus](https://github.com/umeboshi2/conspectus.git).\n  \n  - Partition recipes and raid recipes are created and edited on web interface.\n\n  - Machines can be set/unset for installation.\n\n  - Architecture and OS type can be set.\n\n", "id": "news"}
