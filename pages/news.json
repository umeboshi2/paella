{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n## NEWS\n\n- Paella is being rewritten completely.  \n\n- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is being used to create a \n  testing environment.\n\n- Currently using chef/debian-7.4 vagrant box \n\n- Using Debian Installer via PXE for first stage install\n\n- Using [salt](http://saltstack.org/) for second stage\n  installation and configuration.\n\n- Using system [uuid's](#pages/system-uuid) to for machine \n  identification and network access.  MACs from ethernet interfaces\n  are no longer required to identify machines. (Code to consistently\n  generate a uuid based on network interfaces on machines lacking\n  a SMBIOS to retrieve the system uuid from should be looked into\n  using.  It is expected that most i386/amd64 machines will have\n  a system uuid, however armhf (raspberrrypi) machines won't have\n  this.\n\n- Currently supporting i386 and amd64 debian installs.\n\n- A preliminary environment exists to help manage windows \n  installations.  The installation of a customized system \n  can be performed automatically, but the system can, and \n  for the time being will have to be, configured manually \n  using sysprep.\n\n- Web interface to help manage machines and configurations.  The web\n  server uses [trumpet](https://github.com/umeboshi2/trumpet.git),\n  which is a small collection of code to help make pyramid web services that\n  support RESTful interaction.  The client side browser application uses the\n  \"paella\" branch of [conspectus](https://github.com/umeboshi2/conspectus.git).\n  \n\t  - Partition recipes and raid recipes are created and edited on web interface.\n\n\t  - Machines can be set/unset for installation.\n\n\t  - Architecture and OS type can be set.\n\n\n## links\n\n### Windows Deployment\n- [Windows Deployment Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Deployment_Services) to the network.\n\n- [wimboot](http://ipxe.org/wimboot) - boot wim images via pxe\n\n### Unique ID\n- [debian wiki id systems](https://wiki.debian.org/HowToIdentifyADevice/System)\n\n- [generate unique id](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/144812/generate-consistent-machine-unique-id)\n\n### UEFI and PXE\n- [uefi-pxe-netboot-install](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/PXE-netboot-install)\n\n- [ubuntu secure boot](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/SecureBoot)\n\n- [uefi-pxe-win8](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj938037.aspx)\n\n- [dhcp options for pxe](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4578)\n\n### Wikipedia Articles\n- [Wikipedia article on PXE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment)\n\n- [Wikipedia article on UEFI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface)\n\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition\n\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table\n\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_BIOS\n\n###Misc\n- [virtualbox uefi support for windows guests]( https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7702)\n\n- [Protecting the pre-OS env with UEFI - building win8](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx)\n\n- [reflections on trusting trust (reloaded)](https://www.hackinparis.com/sites/hackinparis.com/files/JohnButterworth.pdf)\n\n", "id": "news"}
