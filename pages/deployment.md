# [Paella](#)

## Outline

How is paella going to work?

Two deployment scenarios:

1. Set up a network in the office or workplace of a person who creates servers 
   for people.  This person can use paella to create fully configured machines 
   that can be physically carried and installed at another location.

2. Set up a network where the hosts on the network are installed and managed 
   by a paella server.
