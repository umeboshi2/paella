The \nVagrantfile creates a virtualbox machine with two network interfaces.  \nThe second network is a virtualbox internal network where the installation \nsystem is hosted.  The installation system can be tested by creating virtual \nmachines and booting from the internal network to define and install the \nsystem.\n\nAt the moment, there is only the proof of concept installer that installs a \nminimal i386 system.\n\n", "id": "vagrant"}
