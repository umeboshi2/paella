{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n## Vagrant\n\n### Introduction\n\nVagrant is used to establish a testing environment for paella.  The \nVagrantfile creates a virtualbox machine with two network interfaces.  The \nsecond network is a virtualbox internal network where the installation system \nis hosted.  The installation system can be tested by creating virtual \nmachines and booting from the internal network to define and install the \nsystem.\n\nAt the moment, there is only the proof of concept installer that installs a \nminimal i386 system.\n\n### Set up the Environment\n\n(This hasn't been tested on windows)\n\nFirst you will need to have [Virtual Box](http://virtualbox.org) installed \non your system.  Then make sure to download and\ninstall [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your system.  I \nused version 1.5.1 when creating the system.  As of this writing, the \ncurrent version is 1.5.3, which should work, as well as later versions \n1.x.x.  Once vagrant is installed, you will need two plugins.\n\n```sh\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-salt\n```\n\nThen in the project directory:\n\n```sh\nvagrant up\n```\n", "id": "vagrant"}
