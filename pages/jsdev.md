# [Javascript Dependencies](#)

# Basic Javascript Libraries

-  [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/):
   The app is written with coffee script.
  
-  [Requirejs](http://requirejs.org):
   This library is required to load the other modules.
   
-  [jQuery](http://jquery.com/): 
   jQuery is a very good for selecting and maninpulating elements in the DOM.

-  [jQuery User Interface](http://jqueryui.com/): 
   jQueryUI is used for the fullcalendar widget, as well as for dialog boxes 
   and other user interface elements that aren't used through boostrap.  The 
   corresponding styles are maintained with compass.

-  [Bootstrap v3](http://getbootstrap.com/): 
   Bootstrap is a CSS/Javascript framework used to help make responsive 
   websites.  Bootstrap was selected to be used in order to serve to 
   mobile devices.  The CSS is handled through compass with bootstrap-sass.
   
-  [LoDash](FIXME): 
   I decided to use lodash instead of underscore.  Quite a few of the
   utilities provided by this library are easily handled with coffee script,
   however, backbone and marionette depend on this library.

-  [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/): 
   Backbone is an excellent library that provides an api to make very 
   rich views tied to models that are seamlessly synchronized with 
   the server via a REST interface.

-  [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/):
   "Backbone.Marionette is a composite application library for 
   Backbone.js that aims to simplify the construction of large scale 
   JavaScript applications," and it is very effective at doing this.
   This is the primary library used in this project for creating 
   single page applications.

-  [Ace Editor](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about): 
   The ACE editor is a good text editor that is very useful for 
   editing html, css, java/coffee scripts, and other formats that
   aren't being used yet.
   
-  [Teacup](http://goodeggs.github.io/teacup/):
   I really like teacup.  This selection is a result of a
   very intensive search and test pattern that looked at
   many different javascript html templating solutions and
   teacup really stood out.
   
-  [FullCalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/): 
   FullCalendar is a very good library that provides an interactive 
   calendar where events can be retrieved dynamically and grouped, 
   colored, or otherwised styled in many ways.  The calendar provides 
   monthly, weekly, and daily view models to interact with.

-  [jQuery User Interface](http://jqueryui.com/): 
   jQueryUI is used for the fullcalendar widget, as well as for dialog boxes 
   and other user interface elements that aren't used through boostrap.  The 
   corresponding styles are maintained with compass.
