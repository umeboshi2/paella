{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n### Preseed builder\n\nThe preseed is currently a [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) template \nthat is served from the paella [server](#pages/paella-server). \n\nThe preseed file has certain responsibilities beyond automating the first \nstage of the installation.\n\n1. The early command must download and execute a  script that:\n\n\t- Has the ability to run in the minimal busybox environment.\n\t\n\t- Overrides the archive.gpg in the installer environment with the \n\t  key from the local repository. This is necessary because the \n\t  initrd contains the archive key and there is no other manner of\n\t  being able to retrieve the udeb packages from the local repository \n\t  other than modifying the initrd.\n\t  \n\t- (Possibly) Determines the partman recipe for the machine and installs it \n\t  to the installer filesystem (/tmp/disk-recipe). This is not \n\t  implemented yet.  The recipe could also be included directly \n\t  in the preseed since it's coming from the server anyway.\n\t\n2. The preseed file must install salt-minion.\n\n3. The preseed file must handle the disk in the manner provided by the \n   recipe that is attached to the machine.  This could be done by downloading \n   a file into the installer environment, or it could be done by using \n   the preseed template to directly insert the recipe.\n   \n4. The late command must download and execute a script that:\n\n\t- Configures salt-minion with the identity of the machine.\n\t\n\t- Send a post request to the server informing it that stage one is almost\n\t  complete.  This will cause the server to delete the pxe config \n\t  files.  The default pxe config is configured to boot from the first \n\t  hard disk in ten seconds if a key isn't pressed, which helps in the \n\t  case that the computer always boots from the network first.\n\n\t- Preseeds the salt-minion with the installer keys. (This isn't implemented\n\t  yet.  The master is running in open mode.)  The request made above should \n\t  signal the server to locate the minion keys for the machine, and if no \n\t  keys are found, to generate them.  The paella server should keep track of \n\t  all the keys and only set the master to accept those that it preseeds.\n\t\n\n", "id": "preseed"}
