### Pillar Data

The default pillar data is in a git repository.  I desire for these pillar 
files, eventually, to be python scripts that access a database using 
SQLAlchemy.

There are currently other problems with having the data in a pillar.  The 
ability to refer to pillar keys within the pillar is not directly 
available.  Due to the fact that pillar data is basically a set of nested 
dictionaries, it should be possible to achieve the desired results through 
a different pillar rendering system.
