{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n## Outline\n\nHow is paella going to work?\n\nTwo deployment scenarios:\n\n1. Set up a network in the office or workplace of a person who creates servers \n   for people.  This person can use paella to create fully configured machines \n   that can be physically carried and installed at another location.\n\n2. Set up a network where the hosts on the network are installed and managed \n   by a paella server.\n\n## Where is this stuff useful?\n\nPaella is not designed for deploying debian systems in a cloud environment.  \nThere are plenty of tools to help with this, and ability to use \n[salt](saltstack.org), or another configuration system, is already \ngenerally available.  Paella, due to how it uses the debian installer \nin an automated fashion, could be useful in creating the base images that \nwill be deployed in a cloud environment, but this is not why it was \ndesigned.\n\nPaella could be very useful in server farms where machines are added and \nremoved as needed.  Again, I didn't design paella for use in those \nenvironments, but it could be very easily done.  If each machine in the \nserver farm was configured to boot from the network automatically, and \nthe autoinstall property is set for each machine, the network can be \ncompletely managed remotely.\n\n## Interesting Links\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/unattended/\n\nhttp://www.thewindowsclub.com/the-system-preparation-tool-sysprep-in-microsoft-windows-7\n\nhttp://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Windows_PE\n\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709665(WS.10).aspx\n\nhttps://eldon.me/?p=73\n\n\nDriverPacks with Sysprep\n\nhttp://forum.driverpacks.net/viewtopic.php?id=4849\n\n## Windows Stuff\n\n### Netboot a PE environment\n\nUse wimlib to make pe iso.\nnetboot iso and server iso http instead of tftp (ipxe or gpxe?)\n\nor\n\nUse PXE entirely, (seems that sending the winpe.wim will \ntake too long).\n\n### Configure PE environment\n\nAnother approach:  make custom winpe iso for each machine on demand.\nAutounattend.xml for specific machine on iso root directory.\nmachine.ini for machine information\n\nwinpe environment script:\n\n```\nnet use z: \\\\paella\\win7\nz:\nsetup.exe\n```\n\nHopefully if windows installer picks up Autounattend.xml on cd drive\nthings will be ok.\n\nAlternate idea:\n\nHave the Autounattend.xml on the top directory of a samba share \nand map the drive before calling win7 setup.  This will be better \nif it works.  The docs I've read say that setup looks at the root \ndirectory of each bootable disk.  I am hoping that it looks at the \nroot directory of each attached drive.\n\n\n\n", "id": "deployment"}
