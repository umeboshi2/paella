{"content": "# Debian Installer\n\nWhen paella was first created, the debian installer was not the modular and\nhighly configurable application that it is now.  It was generally less trouble to\nuse a live system to partition the disk, debootstrap a system, install packages,\nthen configure the kernel and bootloader.  A live system was, and still is, far more\nflexible and easier to manipulate than the debian installer.\n\nThrough a careful use of the kernel command line, special preseed files, as well\nas early and late scripts, the debian installer can be used as a predictable\napplication where much effort has been spent on successfully installing a system\nwhere the hardware, disk configuration, and boot methods can vary considerably.\nWhile the debian installer system is very limited with respect to a full featured\ndebian-live system, it has the advantage of being easier to maintain consistent\ninstallation quality with relatively low maintainence.  There are a larger number\nof people making sure the debian installer works correctly, than the number of\npeople who are concerned that a custom system installs a debian system correctly.\n\n", "id": "debian-install"}
