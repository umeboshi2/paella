## Vagrant

Vagrant is used to establish a testing environment for paella.  The 
Vagrantfile creates a virtualbox machine with two network interfaces.  
The second network is a virtualbox internal network where the installation 
system is hosted.  The installation system can be tested by creating virtual 
machines and booting from the internal network to define and install the 
system.

At the moment, there is only the proof of concept installer that installs a 
minimal i386 system.
