# [Paella](#)

## Introduction 

Paella is a system for automatically installing fully configured 
[debian](http://debian.org) machines on a local network, and managing 
their configuration.  Paella combines PXE booting, preseeded base debian 
installs, and [salt](http://saltstack.org) to install a fully configured 
system and maintain the configuration.
