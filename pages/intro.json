{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n## Introduction \n\nPaella is a system for that has been used to install preconfigured \ndebian systems over a local network in a manner similar to FAI_.  The \nproject started in 2004 as a set of scripts within the FAI installer than \ncommunicated with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve the configuration for \nthe target machine.\n\nThe old website for this project is at http://paella.berlios.de\n\n## Outline\n\nHow is paella going to work?\n\nTwo deployment scenarios:\n\n1. Set up a network in the office or workplace of a person who creates servers \n   for people.  This person can use paella to create fully configured machines \n   that can be physically carried and installed at another location.\n\n2. Set up a network where the hosts on the network are installed and managed \n   by a paella server.\n\n", "id": "intro"}
