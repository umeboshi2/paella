{"content": "# [Paella](#)\n\n## Introduction \n\nPaella is a system for automatically installing fully configured \n[debian](http://debian.org) machines on a local network, and managing \ntheir configuration.  Paella combines PXE booting, preseeded base debian \ninstalls, and [salt](http://saltstack.org) to install a fully configured \nsystem and maintain the configuration.\n\nPaella requires quite a few things in order to operate.  The best way to \nget things started is to use [Virtual Box](http://virtualbox.org) and \n[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) to install and configure the Paella \nserver.  The complexity of installing and configuring the network \nservices, creating the debian repositories, creating and installing \nthe default live system, is handled by provisioning the vagrant virtual \nmachine with salt.  Instructions for using vagrant to setup paella are \n[here](#pages/vagrant)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "intro"}
