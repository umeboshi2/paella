# If your Shorewall configuration requires detection of the ip address of a ppp
# interface, you must list such interfaces in "wait_interface" to get Shorewall
# to wait until the interface is configured. Otherwise the script will fail
# because it won't be able to detect the IP address.
#
# Example:
#    wait_interface="ppp0"
# or
#    wait_interface="ppp0 ppp1"
# or, if you have defined  in /etc/shorewall/params
#    wait_interface=
